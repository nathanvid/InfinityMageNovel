Arriving at the Carmis estate, Sirone straightened his clothing and walked toward the arched entrance gate.

Beyond the white iron bars stretched the characteristically free-spirited garden unique to the Carmis family.

The guards with their sharp, vigilant eyes scanning the surroundings were exactly the same as before.

Sure enough, as Sirone approached, a guard's right hand moved reflexively toward the hilt of the sword at his waist.

"Halt. What business brings you here?"

The only difference from six months ago was that they spoke respectfully.

The guards at noble estates typically changed shifts every four hours and rotated positions monthly, so the guards from back then wouldn't be stationed here now.

Yet the reason they couldn't treat Sirone carelessly was because they sensed an extraordinary aura about him, unlike ordinary people.

During his year at magic school, Sirone had shed much of his mountain valley boy appearance.

Particularly, the experience gained from real combat and the elevated mental strength cultivated through training emanated an aura that even guards unfamiliar with magic could perceive.

"I'm Amy's friend. Is Amy inside?"

The guards tilted their heads in puzzlement and exchanged meaningful glances with each other.

Sirone had once entered Amy's room six months ago, which had been strictly off-limits to men.

But since that day, no case had occurred where someone claiming to be Amy's boyfriend was granted entry, so it was natural that guards unaware of that incident wouldn't believe him.

"There are no scheduled guests today. If you have business, please follow the proper procedures."

It was the answer he had expected.

Sirone clicked his tongue and turned around.

He had hoped to enter immediately if luck was on his side, but since things had gone awry, he had no choice but to write a letter and send it to the estate.

"It's fine. Let him in."

At that moment, a welcome voice came from inside the main gate.

When Sirone turned back around, Adel, the head butler of the Carmis family, stood there with a smile on his face.

The guards straightened their backs rigidly.

To them, who lived together in the estate, the kind-faced Adel seemed like a messenger from hell.

Leaning on his cane as he crossed the main gate, Adel stopped in front of Sirone and gazed intently into his eyes.

Remembering what had happened six months ago, Sirone mentally prepared himself in advance.

The eye technique he had experienced for the first time—Pressing.

If it was the head butler of the Carmis family, that wouldn't even be his full effort, so he needed to stay sharp.

However, Adel didn't employ any technique. He simply bowed at a right angle and offered a respectful greeting.

"Welcome, Young Master Sirone."

Sirone stood there dumbfounded as his tension released, then hurriedly came to his senses and bowed in return.

"Yes, have you been well?"

"Hoho, an old man's daily routine doesn't change much. I see you've come to meet Miss Amy."

"Yes, I'm sorry for visiting without notice. Is she home by any chance?"

Adel scratched his eyebrow with a troubled expression.

"You must be aware of the situation. Actually, because of that, Miss Amy has been feeling a bit unwell lately. The day before yesterday, Miss Seriel came to visit but just returned home."

"Ah, I see."

If it was Seriel, she was Amy's closest friend. If Amy had turned away even her, it meant she was serious about this.

But Sirone didn't give up.

"Please just tell her I came. If she still says no, I'll just go back."

Adel hesitated for a moment, then nodded.

The truth was, the atmosphere in the estate had been terrible ever since Amy failed the graduation exam. But since she wasn't the type to show her irritation outwardly, they could only watch her carefully without being able to comfort her directly.

But with Sirone, there might be a change.

After all, this boy was the only friend who could enter Amy's house with the qualification of being a man.

"Understood. Please wait a moment."

After instructing the guards to treat Sirone with courtesy, Adel boarded the carriage waiting in the garden.

'It's been about six months. What on earth has he been through?'

Once the carriage started moving, Adel's expression finally grew serious.

Using Pressing on men who approached Amy was both a small pastime and minor pleasure that only the head butler could enjoy.

But this time, he couldn't even dare to attempt Pressing.

Sirone's mind was much more sharply honed than before.

No, even calling it sharp was insufficient.

'Eeriness.'

The moment he tried to make eye contact to apply Pressing, he felt all the hair on his body stand on end.

His overall temperament didn't seem to have changed particularly.

His intelligent, bright, and kind nature remained exactly as it had been six months ago.

However, the energy felt from his gaze was subtly sharp.

'Something else is living there. Something very terrifying...'

It was something only someone at the level of head butler of the Carmis family, the highest noble house, could perceive.

He couldn't guess what it was, but if threatened, it would definitely emerge and devour him.

In that brief moment when their eyes met, Adel realized that such a situation must never occur.

It was that violent and extreme a monster.

'Would it be alright to let him in? Of course, he wouldn't have come to visit a friend harboring an uncontrollable inner demon, but...'

Adel reserved judgment on this matter.

There was no way Shakora, the family head, wouldn't know what he himself knew. Not to mention the person in question.

Reaching that point in his thoughts, a bitter smile appeared.

'...What a truly extraordinary boy.'

How long ago had it been since he felt something that made his knees tremble, even briefly?

Sirone had sealed such a monster deep within himself.

'He's become even stronger in six months. What tremendous talent.'

The Carmis family was known for their bloodline of geniuses. Particularly Amy's talent was unparalleled even among the family members.

But the scope of Sirone's growth transcended imagination.

If Amy was the fastest sprinter among humans, then Sirone was a giant with an entirely different dimension of stride.

'What drives him?'

The carriage stopped, and with it, Adel's thoughts ceased.

Carrying the unanswerable question in his heart, he opened the door to the estate.

Though considerable time had passed since the graduation exam ended, a rather solemn atmosphere still lingered.

For Adel, who had lived his whole life loving the diverse atmospheres of the Carmis family members, it was a difficult problem to adapt to.

"Master."

Shakora, who had been reading a newspaper, turned his gaze.

"Young Master Sirone has come to see Miss Amy. However, the young miss has notified the butler's office that she won't meet with anyone..."

"Hmm, Sirone has?"

Shakora understood Amy's feelings.

His daughter, who was full of pride, had botched the graduation exam completely—how mortified she must be.

But with Sirone, there was room to consider her intentions.

Though Seriel had been refused, the emotions between a man and woman were distinctly different after all.

Isis, who had been listening from the kitchen, came out and spoke.

"I'll ask Amy about it first."

Isis went upstairs to Amy's room on the second floor.

After briefly hearing the sound of quiet conversation, she came out of the room again, approached the railing, and shook her head.

Having received Amy's intentions through this, Adel bowed his head without hesitation.

"Then I shall send Young Master Sirone away."

"No, tell him to come in."

At Shakora's words, Isis made a worried expression.

"But dear, Amy is..."

"It's fine. When I saw Sirone at school, didn't I tell him to come visit? Sending him back like this wouldn't be proper. I want to meet him myself. Let him in."

"Understood."

Thinking that at least Sirone wouldn't be disappointed, Adel left the estate with a much brighter expression.

Ten minutes later, Sirone arrived at the estate.

Shakora was sitting on the sofa waiting, and Isis brought out tropical fruits on a tray right on time.

Sirone walked toward Shakora and bowed his head.

"Hello, Father."

"Yes, good that you came. Come sit here."

Sirone sat on the sofa and waited for the conversation to begin.

Having heard that the household atmosphere wasn't good upon entering, he didn't bring up Amy first.

Like Adel, Shakora also instantly perceived Sirone's subtly sharpened temperament.

During the graduation exam, he had been too preoccupied with worry about his daughter to examine deeply, but now that his daughter had failed, his interest in Sirone's achievements as a parent had grown.

'The kingdom's top prospect...'

Of course, that was an evaluation excluding the graduating class.

But even including the graduating class, he didn't think Sirone's evaluation would fall significantly.

Though he hadn't revealed it to Amy, Shakora had been such an enthusiastic father that he clipped articles about events in magical society since she entered school. The student he had heard about ad nauseam was none other than Dante.

When Sirone defeated Dante, the kingdom's number one, even he couldn't help but be surprised.

But seeing him now confirmed it wasn't luck or chance.

In the eyes of one who had achieved spiritual mastery like a monk burned a desire that transcended the mundane world.

While Adel had called it a monster, Shakora thought differently.

That too was Sirone.

'It's not something you can obtain just anywhere. Was a latent tendency manifested through acquired experience? But how?'

He had already received the story about the harsh experiences in the Kingdom of Kasula. Even so, it was far too transcendent an inner demon for an eighteen-year-old boy to embrace.

Realizing that there had been no conversation for a long time, Shakora returned to being a doting father and smiled bitterly.

"She's not actually very sick."

"Yes, I understand."

He probably thought so.

But the reason he didn't think it was a lie was because it might be a more serious condition than physical pain.

Shakora scratched his head as if finding it difficult.

"Honestly, I'm not sure. She doesn't seem to be particularly struggling, but she appears a bit dejected. You would understand, wouldn't you?"

"Of course. I would have been the same way."

Rather, it's bearable at first.

Since things had turned out this way, one might resolve to start over.

But thinking about having to repeat grueling training for a whole year, the failure of the graduation exam would pierce to the bone.

With each passing day, regret would grow heavier and self-loathing would endlessly weigh down the heart.

"Amy is strong. She's given her absolute best since she was twelve to get this far. That's probably why the wound runs deeper."

"Yes, it's best to leave her alone for now. Anyway, that's Amy's current state."

Shakora shrugged in surrender. It meant there was nothing he could do to help while his daughter was in such a mood.

Turning his gaze to the second floor, Sirone confirmed that Amy's room was tightly closed.

He seemed to hear the sorrowful crying he had heard outside the dormitory door the day the graduation exam ended.

"May I go up and see her?"

Isis made a troubled expression and said,

"I asked her, but Amy said she was sick and to send you away. With that child's personality, if you just barge in..."

"Haha! Then I'll get hit once, I suppose."

Sirone replied playfully. But on the other hand, he was conveying his intention to never give up.

Shakora exhaled with a "hmm" and fell into thought.

Only Sirone could understand Amy's heart 100 percent.

Also, the fact that such a considerate child was being stubborn meant Amy's condition was much more serious than expected.

If there was no breakthrough, shock therapy might be a good method.

"Go see Amy's room. I give you permission."

"Yes, thank you."

Sirone left the sofa and went up the stairs to the second floor.

Watching this, Isis asked Shakora with an anxious expression.

"Dear, what are you trying to do? With Amy's personality..."

"It's fine. He understands Amy's current psychological state better than anyone. Actually, Sirone could just go home and be done with it. But the fact that he insists on meeting her to the end means this situation can't continue."

"What if things get even worse?"

"I said it's fine. Above all, he's a friend Amy trusts."

Isis glared at Shakora and pouted.

'What's with praising a boy for once? Such a daughter-doting fool...'
