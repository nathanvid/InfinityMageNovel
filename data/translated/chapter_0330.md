"Insight. So self-image memory corrects errors in the shortest possible time. That's truly an incredible ability. Looking at talent alone, you'd probably be the best not just at Alpheas Magic School, but on the entire continent. The countless geniuses your family has produced prove that."

Amy couldn't argue with that.

The pretentious members of the Carmis family—no, even just her older brothers from the main house—had already made names for themselves across the continent in their respective fields at young ages.

"So what? I've never once thought about relying on my family! Are you saying I only made it this far because of talent? I've always tried to stand on my own."

"Exactly. That's what makes it childish."

Amy's face hardened coldly.

"You should rely on your family instead. Everything you have, everything your family has. You need to mobilize everything and fight with it all. You were born with things others could never have even if they wanted them, yet you throw it all away just because you want to do it alone? That's what makes it childish."

"I... I never thought of it that way..."

"Remember those kids we met at the skating rink? Jokre, was it? Eins Magic School honestly isn't a prestigious school. Those children's talents are probably far inferior to yours. Yet they're finding their own way to survive and become mages. You think they failed because they were unlucky? No, Amy. You're competing in one of the kingdom's five most prestigious schools. There are countless people in this world more wronged than you. If you want to become a mage—if you want to become the best mage—you have to fight and overcome whatever situation comes your way."

Amy lowered her head.

Her anger had already vanished.

No, everything felt like it had returned to square one.

Dante's words were right.

The place she belonged was Alpheas Magic School, where the kingdom's greatest talents gathered, and specifically the graduating class at its very peak.

A position where excuses couldn't be made.

In this battlefield where only the best talents clashed while looking toward the summit, any complaints would be nothing more than the idle chatter of the privileged.

"Then what... should I do?"

She stood at the starting point again, unable to leap over the wall.

The second time would be faster.

But that was only a thought in her head.

Now she had to overcome herself. And for Amy, this was her first real trial.

'Amy...'

Shirone looked at Amy with pity.

Dante's direct way of speaking must have been a huge shock to her. But he couldn't interfere.

It wasn't arrogant thinking that he could help Amy.

It was because what Dante said was true.

Silence settled over the table.

Even the laughter of tourists chattering all around them couldn't reach their ears.

Dante sipped his cold coffee while observing Amy.

He didn't have any particular feelings for her. But Amy had also been the most irritating presence during the graduation exam.

"Should I tell you why you failed?"

Amy raised her head again.

Shirone, who had been lost in thought, also looked at Dante.

An analysis from Dante, whose specialty was information processing, would be worth hearing regardless of the situation.

"Of course, I only saw you operate magic during the graduation exam. And that was less than five minutes. But even in that short time, there was something that particularly didn't make sense."

"Are you saying I made poor judgments?"

"No. It's a problem closer to the essence than that. To get to the point, you have a fatal weakness. Especially if you're aiming to be a battle mage, you're missing something absolutely essential."

She had never thought she had any weaknesses. So Amy swallowed hard and waited for what would come next.

Dante picked up his coffee cup and turned his head. After choosing his words for a moment, he pursed his lips and spoke.

"You... have no style."

"Style?"

Amy asked back at the unexpected words. But Shirone was nodding slightly.

No style.

It was a phrase that encapsulated the vague sense of discord he had always felt while being with Amy.

Being able to clearly identify Amy's weakness after watching just five minutes of combat was something only possible with Dante's eyes, having the kingdom's greatest defensive capabilities.

Shirone added a comment.

"To put it nicely, you're versatile. I've felt this for a while, but you're so amazing it's actually a problem."

Amy's face flushed hot at Shirone's words. Having been shocked by Dante's blunt words, her embarrassment was even greater.

"Are you making fun of me now?"

Dante shook his head.

"No, Shirone has a point. From what I've seen, you have a tendency to try to control situations perfectly. Because you can do it."

"How is that a problem?"

"It's a huge problem. Your specialty is sniper mode. Most mages guide situations toward environments where their specialties can be optimized. That's where style emerges. Shirone likes strategies that crush with brute force because he has Immortal Function. I like counters because I enjoy analyzing opponents. But you're different. When sniper mode isn't working out, you immediately look for a second solution."

Amy felt dazed as if she'd been hit in the head with a hammer.

"Do you know what's really serious? You actually pull it off. You find that second solution. You're too resourceful. But how long can that approach work?"

Amy's lips trembled.

Stupid. Foolish.

Why had she never thought about it even once?

"Normally you'd hit a wall at the student level. But your talent carried you all the way to the graduating class. Then you hit the wall at the most crucial moment."

Dante pressed his palm against his fist.

"The situation where all participants were targeting you. Facing a difficulty that spiked far above graduating class lessons, you experienced for the first time a situation that couldn't be handled with talent alone. The obstacle that Nade and I encountered early on appeared too late for you. Fermi probably already knew about it—your fatal weakness. That's exactly why you were chosen as the sacrifice."

Dante gave examples while recalling the graduation exam.

"The moment you felt the tide of battle changing rapidly, you abandoned Samuel and targeted Fermi. You probably judged that with Schema, you could gain an advantage even in close combat. But that's where things went wrong. The moment you felt something was off, you should have unconditionally created distance. You should have somehow led the situation to one where you could optimize sniper mode. But you didn't."

Shirone picked up the thread.

"Because you were confident you could somehow resolve it."

Dante nodded.

"It's impossible to control every situation in a melee. Even one second is too long when you need time to judge during combat. When choices split, delays are inevitable. That's why style is important. You trust your style and bet everything on it."

Amy recalled the situation in Kasula when she was bound by Zenogger's spider web.

She had thought too much then too.

But if she had only focused on what she could do, she could have melted the web with Ignite and escaped.

"You probably analyzed everything in the graduating class. The combat power, judgment, habits, actions of all participants. You analyzed everything about them and concluded that you had the advantage, right?"

Amy honestly admitted it.

"That's right. Exactly."

"But you didn't think about style. That's just as important as combat power. You need to know when to avoid and wait if the matchup isn't favorable. If I went back to the past right now and fought Shirone from back then, I'd probably win with a 90 percent probability."

Shirone nodded readily.

There are no ifs in history, but if his past self faced the current Dante, it would likely be a losing battle nine times out of ten.

"Combat isn't a matter that can be measured by skill alone. To put it extremely, even Shirone's Ataraxia could be destroyed before completion. So why wasn't I able to succeed? Because Shirone also constantly guided situations to his advantage. A clash of style versus style. That's what mage combat is."

Amy remained motionless with her head lowered.

Her mind was completely filled with thoughts about magic, unable to see anything else.

Dante said:

"Well, I was showing off, but I might fail too if a similar situation arose. But I wouldn't be eliminated early without being able to do anything like you. Anyway, this is the result of my analysis after watching you in the graduation exam."

Amy finally raised her head. Her expression was still filled with sadness, but the excitement had already disappeared.

"Thank you for being honest with me."

Having one's strengths and weaknesses analyzed by someone who would be a competitor next year was something to be grateful for, regardless of the reason.

Dante seemed embarrassed by the solemn atmosphere and finished the conversation while getting up from his seat.

"Seems like I brought up an unnecessary topic during your date. Anyway, I'll be going now. Have fun, you two. See you at school later."

Shirone escorted him to the door.

Dante observed Amy through the window from outside the cafe.

Confirming her dejected expression, he looked back at Shirone and scratched his head.

"Sorry. It seemed like the mood was good, but I interfered and ruined it."

Having dated quite frequently at Royal Magic School, Dante had detected the subtle current flowing between Shirone and Amy.

The fact that Amy had come along on their trip for two meant she was thinking about it to some degree.

If the atmosphere from the skating rink had continued, Shirone and Amy's tomorrow might have been different.

But today's advice would inevitably complicate Amy's thoughts.

As a fellow man, it was natural to feel sorry.

But Shirone didn't think that way. Rather, he was grateful to Dante for not sparing advice for Amy.

"It's fine. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been able to identify Amy's problems. It was really helpful. Of course, Amy will have to research the solution herself."

Dante smiled bitterly.

Shirone seemed completely untainted by worldly concerns.

Then again, in some sense, Amy also belonged to the same category as Shirone, so it could be said they had met properly.

Dante had always only had instant romances. It suited his personality, so he had no particular complaints about it.

But on the other hand, he thought it might be interesting to slowly match emotions like a slowpoke.

"It wasn't advice specifically for Amy's sake. There will probably be Fermi's group next year too. It's good to create as many rivals as possible. Anyway, see you next time. Have fun."

Dante waved and walked away.

Watching him depart as lightly as he had arrived, Shirone could sense a traveler's leisure and freedom.

'May you have a good journey too.'

A Midwinter Night (1)

Since it was winter, the sun set early.

The old castle site closed its tourist areas at 6 PM, so Dante decided to end his sightseeing and head to his lodging.

'It's too early to just go in, maybe I'll have a beer?'

At eighteen, you could buy alcohol outside.

He didn't care much for hard liquor, but Dante enjoyed sipping beer while traveling.

The shopping district was bustling with people who had left the tourist attractions.

As he walked looking for a comfortable place to drink, a young woman was holding a street demonstration in front of a third-floor bar.

Her eye-catching outfit caught Dante's attention.

She wore loose clothes with sleeves that came down to her wrists, with a white sash tightly cinched at the waist. Her outer garment came down to her ankles with sharp creases, and her skirt was red.

Dante guessed she was someone involved in religious ceremonies.

Judging by the large backpack that didn't match her slender figure, she had either been traveling for a long time or come from far away.

Perhaps mid-twenties?

She had pure white skin as if she'd never seen sunlight and delicate features. Her black hair, tied high at the crown, hung down below her waist.
