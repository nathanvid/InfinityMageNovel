# Chapter 346 - Divine Transcendence (3)

Her classmates looked at her with envious eyes.

"Tess. I've been thinking this for a while, but you really have a beautiful body. Do you work out separately or something?"

"Work out? What are you talking about? I can barely keep up with training as it is. Besides, it's not exactly a good thing. When we have close combat like today, it gets really cumbersome."

Her classmate gave her a sympathetic smile as if she understood.

"When you're training, you get all sorts of people. There are guys who casually touch you too. Of course, if they tried that with me, I'd break their backs."

Another classmate chimed in.

"It's definitely a disadvantage. Having to compete in strength against muscle monsters who eat nothing but meat ten times a day."

Tess, wearing a tank top, spoke as she put on her training uniform.

"Well, there are events that favor women anyway. In any case, this is the final evaluation, so let's do our best."

"Right. When we get leave, I need to sleep first. And lose some muscle too. This year I'm definitely going to get a boyfriend."

The classmate who had changed clothes asked while loosening up her body.

"Speaking of which, how are things with you, Tess? Are you and Rian still at the same stage? That boy is really indifferent."

Tess, who was stretching her leg back to touch her heel to her buttocks, burst into laughter.

"Haha! It's fine. Rian has big dreams. If my boyfriend succeeds, that's good for me too."

"Oh come on. Don't be like that, try playing hard to get sometimes. A pretty girl like you liking him - he should be bowing in gratitude."

"I'm really fine with it. It's not like he's running away anywhere."

She laughed it off in front of her friends, but her true feelings weren't like that. Lately, Rian had been speaking even less than before. He clearly had something on his mind, but he wouldn't tell her anything about it.

'What is it exactly? Why is he being like this even with me?'

She decided to endure it until today. Tomorrow would be leave anyway, so even if it was a serious worry, she could ask him comfortably then.

As she left the changing room, cadets were heading toward the training ground along the corridor. A man broke away from the crowd and approached Tess. Tess immediately showed her displeasure, but accustomed to social situations, he spoke with affectionate eyes.

"Hello, Tess? Nice seeing you here."

"We're in the same building, so of course we'd see each other. Anyone listening would think we met in hell or something."

The man's name was Bavier. From a first-class noble family, his father was the current Deputy Defense Minister of Tormia.

He was a longtime comrade-in-arms of Tess's father, who was a colonial commander, and had known Tess since childhood.

With his square jaw, blonde hair, and deep eyes, he was attractive by anyone's standards. His body was properly sculpted, and his swordsmanship was excellent, so there were already rumors in social circles that marriage proposals were coming in.

However, Bavier ranked Tess as his first choice to become his woman. The Elzain family's prestige was impressive, but her beautiful appearance and wonderful figure left nothing to be desired as his match.

"Tess. How about dinner tonight? We've been training hard for half a year after all."

"Sorry, but I can't. I have a prior engagement with Rian."

"Don't lie. Everyone knows that guy won't accept you. Why are you being like this? You can at least have dinner with an old friend."

"I don't want to. I don't like you, and I don't like the idea of Rian possibly being conscious of you either. So let's forget our old friendship and pretend we don't know each other."

Bavier sighed. He couldn't understand why the intelligent and sensible Tess was fixated on Rian.

His skills were mediocre, and more importantly, he had no future. How could a swordsman who couldn't even use Schema become a commander?

"Tess. You need to think carefully. How long are you going to act like a child? You have dreams too. With me, you can achieve those dreams. Rian can never make you happy."

Tess kept her mouth firmly shut as if it wasn't even worth answering. Bavier felt an iron wall from her gaze. But the more she resisted, the stronger his possessive desire to have her became.

"Tess. What are you doing? Let's go."

Tess's cold expression instantly brightened. Without even greeting Bavier, she ran to Rian, who was waiting at the end of the corridor.

'That bastard...!'

Bavier trembled with humiliation as he glared at Rian. But as always, Rian simply dispersed his killing intent with an indifferent gaze and turned away.

Rian and Tess walked in silence. Rian had been taciturn lately, and Tess was worried that Rian might be concerned about her relationship with Bavier.

Only after leaving the building did Rian speak.

"Is Bavier bothering you again?"

Tess hurriedly waved her hands.

"No. What could someone like him do to bother me? You're not worried about it, are you? I told him not to even talk to me anymore."

"Don't worry. I'm not concerned about it."

Tess pouted. It would be troublesome if Rian were conscious of Bavier, but hearing such an indifferent answer made her feel like she was being treated as insignificant, which didn't feel good either.

"Rian. Lately you've been..."

"I wonder how strong Shirone has become?"

Tess closed her mouth. What had she been expecting? From the beginning, there had never been a place for her in Rian's thoughts.

The reason Rian underwent extreme training every day was to become a knight who could match Shirone, who was growing at a rapid pace.

For a knight's oath of lord-vassal relationship, it was natural.

However, since Shirone was also a precious friend to her, the problem was that she sometimes forgot about their relationship.

Tess shook off her disappointment and patted Rian's shoulder.

"He must have gotten incredibly strong, right? Shirone is a genius after all. But you've done your best too. He'll be so surprised he'll faint when he sees you now."

Rian smiled bitterly. Every time he gave his all, what he felt was the extraordinariness of the human being called Shirone.

But now he could see the answer to his long contemplation. He wouldn't agonize anymore.

"Right. I'll have to give him a proper surprise."

When they entered the training ground, many cadets were already gathered. After today, the achievements of the kingdom's most promising knight candidates would once again be stamped out on a single report card.

Tess had already secured her position in the leading group by ranking in the top tier in most evaluations.

On the other hand, Rian still couldn't escape last place.

"Company, attention!"

When Kuan entered the training ground, all the cadets stood at attention. The nervous appearance from when they first enrolled had disappeared, and they all radiated disciplined spirit.

"At ease. Today is the wrestling evaluation. You know this, right?"

"Yes, sir!"

The unified chorus echoed.

Even the strict Kuan would have been satisfied, but since he was facing the most unpleasant day of the year, his tone was irritable.

"What are you doing? Remove your shirts."

Buttons were undone as if in a race. The men who exposed their flesh-colored upper bodies paid no heed to the cold and remained motionless, focusing on Kuan.

No one turned their gaze to the female cadets. As those receiving knight training, it would be rude behavior, and even if they had base thoughts, getting caught by Kuan would mean the end.

However, Kuan didn't particularly restrict the men from examining each other's bodies. That was the very essence of male competitiveness and wild instinct.

As the evaluation period approached, the number of cadets using the public baths decreased markedly. Bodies were honest and contained the entire process of training.

Showing one's body before competition wasn't tactically advantageous. The wrestling evaluation, which required removing shirts, was held on the last day for this reason.

The cadets' gazes concentrated on Bavier's body. Large muscles were defined as if he wore armor, and the trapezius muscles starting from his neck were intimidating just to look at.

'That's incredible bulk up. How much did he build in a month?'

'He's like a human golem. If you get caught, you won't even be able to retrieve your bones.'

While Tess, who wielded three swords, ranked first in sword techniques, Bavier, who hoped for heavy infantry as his assignment, was superior in terms of physical ability alone. Wrestling in particular was his specialty, and he was skilled enough to snap a bear's neck with his bare hands.

"Whooooa..."

As exclamations erupted from here and there, Bavier turned his head with a triumphant expression. But the object of admiration wasn't Bavier - it was Rian. Everyone couldn't take their eyes off him.

Rian's body was developed without missing a single small muscle. It was simply amazing that such various muscles could fit within human skin. The feeling of perfect concentration. A firmness was conveyed as if it had been squeezed in a mold.

Even male cadets who wouldn't lose to anyone in terms of physicality were mesmerized, so it was natural that hearts appeared in Tess's eyes.

'Rian...'

But her gaze soon turned wistful. She knew how much pain Rian had endured to complete his current body.

After eating Ymir's arm, Rian's right arm had developed abnormally. While increased strength was good, the broken balance was never a good thing.

From then on, Rian undertook extreme training, swinging a club heavier than a greatsword 3,000 times per day.

The feedback of living beings was truly remarkable - over time, his entire body began to develop in a way that balanced with his right arm.

What was born from this was Rian's current body.

With perfect physical balance, his strength had become four times stronger than six months ago.

He might be the strongest person among those who couldn't use Schema.

'He adapted his body to the sword.'

While the cadets admired Rian's appearance, Kuan was focusing on the functional aspect.

This wasn't a body made for one-dimensional goals like strength or endurance.

It was a form optimized for the work of swinging a sword.

'But it's quite strange. It's not like I've never seen a trained person's body before, but it feels like I'm seeing it for the first time.'

Kuan's sense of unease was accurate.

Rian's body had exceeded the limits of the completion state that ordinary humans could reach, through feedback from his abnormal right arm.

'Anyway, I'll find out by watching. What that body can do among Schema users.'

Kuan put aside his thoughts and raised his head.

"Everyone pay attention. I'll briefly explain today's evaluation."

The cadets who came to their senses focused on Kuan. Even Bavier, who had been glaring at Rian irritably, turned his head.

"Wrestling is a major subject for heavy infantry assignments. Therefore, I won't require special techniques from novices like you. Form pairs and compete, and strikes are allowed in close contact. You can't distinguish them anyway. Because of different weight classes, wins and losses won't be included in evaluation items, and you may also use 'folding.'"

The cadets' eyes changed upon hearing Kuan's last words.

Schema was a virtual human body diagram that exerted effects by overlapping multiple diagrams of specific builds.

'Folding' was an advanced Schema technique that folded a specific human body diagram in half to create an effect similar to overlapping two diagrams.

For example, when a swordsman with strength enhancement as their base technique tree performed folding, their strength would increase by more than double.

At higher levels, there would be two foldings, called 'double.'

This developed into triple, quadruple, and pentuple, with the current known limit of human folding being seven times.

Of course, even a single fold was certainly a difficult technique at the cadet level. However, this was none other than Kaizen Sword School, the prestigious institution where Tormia's most talented individuals gathered.

Even though they were still treated as novices by the instructors, more than half of them could perform basic folding.

Tess looked back at Rian. As expected, his expression was dark. Rian's skills weren't inferior compared to other cadets. But as long as Schema was included in evaluation items, last place would forever be his.

Schema techniques weren't limited to just folding.

There were numerous advanced techniques developed, such as 'penetration,' which manifested the properties of two human body diagrams simultaneously, 'reversal,' which flipped the technique build backwards, and 'intersection,' which folded human body diagrams diagonally.
