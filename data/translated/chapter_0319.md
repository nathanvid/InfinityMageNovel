"If someone received compensation for helping someone else, that would be illegal. But the situation itself is the same. What if Fermi simply helped someone based on his mood? Could that also be called unfair?"

Olivia couldn't answer.

"Graduation exam candidates are ranked from 1st to 30th place. But the gap between students isn't consistent every year. Some years, students of similar levels compete against each other, but other years, exceptional talent emerges and sweeps everything away alone. Fermi's case should be viewed no differently."

"Even so, deliberately failing is problematic. It goes against the purpose of the graduation exam."

Alpheas shook his head.

"Think about Shirone from Class Four. He'll probably advance to the graduating class next year. If Shirone went professional right now, what level do you think he'd be at?"

Olivia placed a finger on her lips, lost in thought.

"Hmm, if we're talking purely about combat ability, he could probably compete up to 8th rank, couldn't he? Actually, everyone below 6th rank is pretty much the same level. They're all neck and neck."

"We can say that because we're looking down from above. From the students' perspective, even a 10th-rank mage is an incredibly high wall. And that's natural. But there are always students who transcend the student level. We can't discuss fairness just because a few such children are included."

"That may be true, but..."

"If we're talking about competitive difficulty, next year's graduating class will be much more intense. The squad of children advancing to the graduating class next semester could be called the strongest in history without exaggeration. But would they complain that the competition is fiercer than other years?"

"But those children wouldn't deliberately fail."

"That's uncertain. I'm not saying they would deliberately fail, but it's difficult to present clear standards for such matters. Whether there's lobbying or not, the free competition system remains unchanged."

Olivia propped her chin up and let out a groan.

Currently, no means existed to overthrow Fermi's dictatorial system. What could a mage with professional-level skills - and questionable unconventional abilities - possibly be thinking when committing such acts?

"So there's ultimately no way to save Amy. It's unfortunate."

"Are you certain that Amy would have had a 100% chance of passing if there had been no collusion?"

Olivia's eyes narrowed at Alpheas's leading question.

"I'm talking about talent alone."

"The Carmis family's Insight is renowned throughout the continent. Whatever you teach her, she absorbs it like a sponge. You could call her a jack-of-all-trades. Of course, she's actually beautiful too."

Olivia shot Alpheas a cold glance. But since it wasn't entirely wrong, she propped her chin up and let out a sigh.

"...Being too pretty is also a burden."

"I've been watching that child since she was twelve. She'll be able to overcome this."

Both turned their heads toward the window. The school where countless incidents had occurred over the year lay quietly asleep like a stage after a performance had ended.

Thus, the magic school's year came to a close.

**Momentary Fracture (1)**

Heaven's 6th Heaven, Jebul.

Two mecha systems existed in the angelic city of Jebul.

One was Ingris, where the Akashic Records resided, and the other was the Great War, Archangel Kariel's laboratory.

The Great War, which had been devastated by Shirone's Photon Cannon, had been completely restored.

The massive pillar-shaped central control system was the tallest structure in the Great War. Beside the pillar emitting five-colored light, a galactic telescope observing the movement of stars rotated smoothly.

The Great War had regained its former appearance. But Heaven had not.

After Shirone's departure, winds of change blew through the 1st Heaven, Shamain. The divine citizens no longer believed that Ra's techniques were solely correct, and some extremists emerged among them.

The more this happened, the more angels mobilized all their capabilities to break through the Labyrinth of Time and Space.

Archangel Kariel led this vanguard.

The Archangel of Birth who had tried to cast the technique of life on Amy, Tess, and Arin when they were captured by the fallen angel Ikasa.

The most intelligent among the angels, he analyzed the Meta Gate that Shirone had left behind when returning to his original world.

And finally, he found the coordinates to the land of earth. But to reach that place, they would absolutely have to break through the Labyrinth of Time and Space.

"Even knowing the coordinates, we have no choice but to break through. But this is quite tricky."

"Then doesn't that make recovering the coordinates meaningless?"

Kariel turned toward the majestic voice.

Recognizing the voice's identity, he smiled. Another archangel, Uriel, floated in the air wearing pure white heavy armor.

Angels were taller than humans, but Uriel's height was the greatest even among angels, reaching three meters. His thickness was as tremendous as his height, with his chest armor reaching up to his chin.

Kariel flapped his light wings once to ascend to the top of the central calculation system. A large screen was installed at 40 meters height, with countless numbers spinning around.

"Not necessarily. The number of Nephilim individuals in the land of earth is now considerable. Even if we break the Labyrinth of Time and Space, we could set up a firewall of sorts. But with coordinates, we can ignore that."

"Breaking the Labyrinth of Time and Space? Wasn't that strategy rejected long ago?"

The only being who could reject an archangel's proposal was Anke Ra. Indeed, when the final war was blocked by the labyrinth, Anke Ra had prohibited investigating the land of earth.

The archangels didn't know the reason, but they couldn't defy the will of Anke Ra, who governed the Akashic Records.

But Kariel hadn't given up.

The decisive catalyst was Shirone's appearance. His existence had changed the divine citizens. And that change was accelerating rapidly with time.

"I have no intention of opposing Ra's will either. It's a precautionary measure, so to speak. The land of earth will have to be conquered someday. If we try to create this and that when the time comes, it might be too late."

"Then... this experiment also lacks certainty."

Kariel raised one corner of his mouth.

He had never lacked certainty before. It was just that every time he tried, the labyrinth responded cleverly and blocked him. Now it felt like he was playing some kind of game with her from somewhere unseen.

But today, even she would have no choice but to give up.

The Labyrinth of Time and Space would be pierced. Anke Ra might not want it, but... what could be done? That too was merely fate.

Kariel flew past the galactic telescope to the western wall. Uriel watched for a moment, then caught up to him instantly, creating a tremendous gale.

"Now, this is my masterpiece I'll introduce today."

"..."

Uriel couldn't offer an evaluation.

Kariel's masterwork was so massive it occupied a quarter of the enormous Great War. It was a rectangular wall measuring 40 meters wide and 70 meters tall.

Uriel, who had seemed like the second coming of a deity just moments before, suddenly felt shabby in front of the wall.

"Quite large."

When Uriel acknowledged it, Kariel became even more triumphant.

"I thought about why we can't break through the Labyrinth of Time and Space. It's because dimensional walls are inherently indestructible. But this Heavenly Waterfall makes it possible. Even indestructible liquid can be shattered if you freeze it. We'll strike the Labyrinth of Time and Space directly."

"A direct strike. So this Heavenly Waterfall is the Labyrinth of Time and Space?"

Specifically speaking, he was quite wrong, but thinking simply, it was a correct opinion.

Well, what did it matter? He had called Uriel today not for his head but for his arms.

"If the Heavenly Waterfall breaks to that degree, the Labyrinth of Time and Space should also shatter. I wanted to add amplification circuits, but it's impossible without Ikael's help."

Uriel avoided responding.

Ikael would not help. Not only had she been imprisoned for committing irreversible sins, but the incident Shirone had caused made the evidence that she was taking humanity's side even more certain.

Kariel knocked on the Heavenly Waterfall.

"How about it? Want to give it a try?"

Uriel wondered whether he should really break this thing.

If the Heavenly Waterfall broke, the Labyrinth of Time and Space would also shatter, Kariel had said. And that would be against Anke Ra's will.

'No, no one can oppose Ra's will. Not because he's strong, but because he is the whole.'

Whatever future comes, Ra is simply Ra. Kariel must know this fact too, which is why he was doing such reckless things.

Uriel decided to be honest. Wasn't it Ikael, not Ra, who had been bothering him from the start?

'Why... did Ikael abandon us?'

Angels had been tasked since ancient times with conveying God's will to the land of earth and also destroying it. Among them, Uriel was an archangel who had made remarkable achievements in destruction. His power had overturned the earth and split the sea in two.

But even Uriel, who had blindly massacred humans, found himself questioning whether he was right when he heard rumors that Ikael might have sided with humanity.

Ikael was always right.

No, it wasn't a matter of right and wrong. Even if she wasn't right, he wanted to follow her. If that was the nature given to him, he would devote his faith even to wrong deeds.

Kariel must have existed his entire life with such thoughts too.

Angels had no concept of mother. But if they had to designate someone as mother, it would only be Ikael. The archangel of archangels who had cared for them since birth.

Uriel glanced sideways at Kariel. Seeing his innocent smile brought back very old memories.

Back then, Kariel's personality wasn't like this either. He was still cunning and perverted, but he didn't obsess over purposes and create things. He would create fun and ingenious objects and give them to Ikael, and she would laugh joyfully and pat Kariel's head.

"Kariel, I could destroy it. You know that too. Do you really want that?"

"Haha! This time won't be easy, I tell you. No, honestly speaking, it must be destroyed. I want to destroy the land of earth as soon as possible, even if it's just one day sooner. If we destroy the Labyrinth of Time and Space, today will be that day."

"Why are you so impatient? Ra hasn't given any word yet. Ymir still hasn't awakened from sleep. Is there really a need to go this far?"

Kariel looked down at the outside of Jebul. The riot that had started in the 1st Heaven Shamain had spread to the 2nd Heaven Rakia, where battles between divine citizens and fallen angels were in full swing.

"Shirone changed Heaven. And this is just the beginning. We must pierce the Labyrinth of Time and Space as quickly as possible and eliminate the humans on earth."

Kariel's concern wasn't incomprehensible.

But it didn't make sense for an archangel who had destroyed countless lands of earth to become impatient over mere divine citizen riots.

"Do you think Ikael will return if we destroy humanity?"

Kariel's face suddenly hardened.

"...What do you mean?"

"Ikael's sin has already been erased. The incident itself doesn't exist, they say. Guffin disappeared as the price. At this point, shouldn't at least the two of us forgive her?"

Kariel's astral body expanded at a terrifying speed.

As the halo spread beyond 40 meters in diameter, the Great War's mecha system sounded emergency alarms. It seemed to represent Kariel's current state of mind.

"The sin was erased? Then what are these filthy memories remaining with us? I don't care about Guffin at all! I just find Ikael disgusting! Never speak of that again!"

"Will you really fight her? Kariel, I ask again. Will I really fight her? That's what I'm asking."

Kariel made an expression where sorrow and anger coexisted.

"She bore a human child!"

The halo sent out wave-like ripples. As the mecha system repeatedly turned on and off, the Great War flickered.
