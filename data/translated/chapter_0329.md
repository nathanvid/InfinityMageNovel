As Dante watched Shirone sewing with the focused intensity of a craftsman, he made an exasperated expression.

"Hey, do you really have to do your sewing here?"

"This is the only coat I brought with me. And if I do it outside, my hands will freeze and it'll be difficult."

Shirone blew warm breath onto his still-cold hands and focused on his sewing again.

After ordering tea at the counter, Dante came back carrying Armand, which Shirone had leaned against the wall.

Shirone only lifted his gaze to examine Armand. The magic sword that had been so finicky was now quiet as a mouse.

As if Dante was worthy enough to examine it.

Since there were people around, Dante held the sword upright without drawing it and examined its exterior.

"Heh, so this is what an S-rank Objet looks like."

He had heard a rough explanation on the way here.

A magic sword equipped with the concepts of Remote Control and Armament.

It was a perfect weapon that not only amplified magical power but also maximized physical offensive and defensive capabilities.

Dante tossed Armand toward the wall. Shirone immediately used Remote Control to guide it precisely back to its original position.

Having seen it with his own eyes, Dante smiled.

"Good weapon. I can understand why it's worth over 4 billion gold when you factor in rarity."

Amy, who had been sitting by the fireplace warming herself by the fire, turned her head and spoke.

"You talk about 4 billion gold so casually? Well, I suppose the Airhine family is a conglomerate ranked in the top 20 of the kingdom's business world. But why does a young master from such a family mooch coffee?"

"Haha! Coffee tastes better when someone else makes it. It tastes even better when someone else buys it. And even our parents would be shocked at 4 billion gold for a single sword."

Shirone, having sewn the first button, connected his needle to the second button as he spoke.

"Too bad. If you were interested, I was thinking of selling it for about 3 billion."

Armand's gem trembled with a humming sound.

"I'm not particularly interested in collecting things. I'm the type who doesn't even buy souvenirs when traveling."

Dante, who casually referred to an S-rank Objet as mere collecting, was definitely not a normal person either.

But Shirone liked that about him.

After all, mages were the type who couldn't see anything except what they personally liked.

While Shirone finished his sewing and put his coat back on, the staff brought their drinks.

Shirone and Amy drank their juice and cocoa in silence for quite a while.

Just moments ago they had been giggling and having a great time, but now that Dante was here, they suddenly seemed reserved.

Dante sat in a slouched position with his legs crossed, sipping his coffee while watching the two of them.

Then he pointed at Amy with the hand holding his coffee cup.

"By the way, how are things?"

"Hm? What do you mean?"

"Neither of you seems like the type to leisurely go on dates. A consolation trip, something like that?"

Shirone put down his cup and looked at Amy. This was the first time she had talked about the graduation exam.

"Hmm."

Amy rested her chin on her hand and looked out the window.

"Honestly, I'm not sure. It's not that I've lost motivation, but it feels too vague, I guess?"

Having had enough time to organize her thoughts, Amy also spoke with a calm expression.

"Anyway, I gave my best effort for six years and took the exam, right? But I failed. I don't know what more I should do. I also have the feeling that simply improving my skills won't be enough. So, how should I put it..."

Amy exhaled and shrugged her shoulders.

"For now, I'm just collecting myself. It's probably a psychological issue about the second attempt. I need to find or create some special opportunity."

Dante nodded.

Of course, he wasn't even considering the possibility of failing the graduation exam. But if he had failed, he would have had the same worries as Amy now.

"I see. But what exactly was the situation at that time? Of course, I watched it too, but it's different from actually being in the field."

Shirone looked at Amy with a tense expression. It would be a memory she absolutely didn't want to recall.

But he also genuinely wanted to hear about it.

Especially since he would have to face Fermi's group after the break, so the more information the better.

Fortunately, Amy didn't look particularly distressed. It seemed she had already overcome the period of one-dimensional suffering.

"The group beating I received... started 1 minute and 32 seconds after the battle began."

Amy's Insight glowed red as she pulled up information from that time.

"As soon as the interpersonal combat category was triggered, the two thousand count activated, and all participants moved at high speed. The first person I thought I should target was Samuel. Other participants seemed to have the same idea."

Shirone said, "Samuel is a spirit language mage."

"Right. Spirit language magic takes time to activate. During training, Samuel's supersonic technique level was 148 syllables per second. It takes at least 4 seconds to activate intermediate magic. But once the spirit language is complete, the amplification power is tremendous, so he's the top priority elimination target in interpersonal combat. But Fermi disrupted the flow."

Amy's face turned serious.

"It was really strange. That feeling. The sense of wrongness. Of course, during the battle I didn't have the mental capacity to think about collusion, but I instinctively decided I needed to change my target to Fermi. That turned out to be a misjudgment. With Lycaon's plasma covering the area, I couldn't see the target clearly. So I attempted close combat, but they seemed to have coordinated plays ready."

Amy fell silent for a while. She seemed to be reviewing the situation when she made that fatal mistake.

As if shaking off regret, she exhaled deeply. Then, returning to reality, she dropped her shoulders.

"After that, the tide turned, and as you know, I was overwhelmed one-sidedly and eliminated early."

Dante, who had been lost in thought, asked, "But didn't Fermi's group always use those kinds of tactics? Coordinated plays, I mean?"

"Right. It's not like I didn't prepare for it. When you enter the graduating class, you train in rotation through six exam subjects. You can identify factions and learn about everyone's abilities. But something was different on exam day. Even if coordinated plays are part of tactics, they didn't need to protect Samuel from concentrated fire. But the atmosphere completely shifted. I still don't really understand why that happened."

"The atmosphere shifted..."

If they could manipulate the battlefield atmosphere at will in interpersonal combat, it meant their abilities were far superior to expectations.

But there was no reason Amy's perceptiveness wouldn't have caught them hiding their abilities. That's why Amy was also confused.

'It's not simple deception tactics. There's something that hasn't been revealed. The ringleader is probably...'

Fermi, ranked first in the graduating class.

Either he could perfectly conceal his allies' abilities, or he could rapidly enhance his allies' abilities.

Whatever method he used, he could definitely do one of those two things.

"Hmm, so ultimately you were overpowered by force. Then there's no room for excuses. No wonder Master Olivia didn't step forward."

Amy shook her head.

Of course, she had no intention of making excuses for her defeat. But she hadn't been eliminated because her abilities were lacking.

If it had been a normal confrontation, if at least the neutral factions hadn't been swayed by Fermi, she would have easily made it to the final ten.

"If those are the rules, I don't want to argue. But compared to the other participants, my abilities were never inferior. I'm not saying Samuel should have been targeted instead of me. I'm saying that if Fermi can control the battlefield flow, whoever becomes the target has no choice but to fall."

Dante blinked in surprise. Looking at Amy's expression, she was being sincere.

"Of course, I can acknowledge that you might feel wronged. But that's how the opponent came at you, right? So isn't it accurate to say you were overpowered by force?"

Amy put down her juice and sighed.

"Haa, you keep not understanding..."

"No, I understood perfectly. Fermi's group controlled the battlefield flow, and everyone targeted you."

"So you're saying that's my fault? Why? Because I usually act obnoxiously? Or because I looked like the easiest target?"

"Don't get so worked up..."

"I don't look like someone who gets worked up!"

Amy slammed the table and stood up. The gazes of everyone in the cafe focused on her.

Conscious of them, Amy quietly sat back down. But her face was still flushed.

"Fine, personal thoughts are free. But I fought desperately in the graduating class for a year and took the exam. If you, Dante, were in the same situation as me, could you still say the same thing?"

Dante didn't answer.

Of course, his opinion hadn't changed.

But making the already agitated girl more upset wouldn't get him a rational response.

'...though that's what I'm thinking.'

Dante was a mage. And Amy was also a mage. Neither of them was suited to hiding facts because of emotions.

"Stop acting spoiled, Amy."

Anger filled Amy's eyes.

"Spoiled? Me?"

"Fine, then shall we ask Shirone? What he thinks about the results of this graduation exam."

When Amy turned around, Shirone swallowed nervously. Whatever answer he gave wouldn't please Amy.

"Shirone, do you think that too? That I'm acting spoiled like Dante says?"

"Uh, well... I don't know? I..."

"Please tell me honestly. I acknowledge both Dante's abilities and yours. If you two see me that way, then that must be right. What I want to know is the exact truth."

Amy was sincere.

As a student majoring in magic, she wasn't weak enough to be comforted by sugar-coated lies.

Above all, she trusted herself.

She absolutely had not failed the graduation exam because she was weak or lacked ability.

Shirone stammered, then unable to bear the weight of silence, spoke with difficulty.

"It was morally wrong exam, that's true. But whatever situation arises... I think a mage should be able to win."

All strength drained from Amy's body.

If even Shirone said that, there was a high probability she was mistaken.

But her heart couldn't accept it.

'Spoiled? Me?'

She had never been lazy once while studying magic. She was confident she had fought more fiercely than anyone.

But spoiled?

What was most crushing was that their judgment, which even she couldn't understand, was likely to be true.

Dante said, "Of course you're strong. The fact that you rose to 5th in the graduating class rankings in just one year is undeniable."

Amy's gaze slowly turned to Dante.

"But strictly speaking, that's because your natural talent is so exceptional."

"Talent...?"

"Currently, Alpheas Magic School has students positioned who rival those of the Royal Magic School. Iruki of Servant, Nade of alchemy, Arin of ultra-light speed, Canis who handles magical creatures, Shirone the unlocker, and me with central computational magic circles. Of course, Sabina and Closer are also formidable. Boyle of summoning magic and Pandora of scent magic also have specialized talents."

Amy listened quietly to Dante's words.

"But in my view, if we were to rank by what you were born with..."

Dante took a sip of coffee and pointed at Amy.

"It's you. You, Amy, are the best at Alpheas Magic School."

Amy wasn't happy.

She still couldn't grasp what Dante was trying to say.
