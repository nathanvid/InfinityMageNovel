**Chapter 348: Divine Transcendence (5)**

'Arrogant little bastard...!'

Bavier attempted a technique. He tried to wrap his arms around Rian's body to disrupt his center of gravity. But Rian similarly swung his arms to interfere with the technique.

Annoyed, Bavier pushed Rian. Then he charged forward with his body again. *Thwack!* A second headbutt was delivered. This time, Rian also felt dizzy.

When the opportunity for a tackle finally presented itself, Bavier rushed forward while embracing Rian's waist. As he tripped Rian's legs while he stumbled backward, his waist opened up. If he could slam him down like this, it would be over.

"Urgh!"

Rian barely managed to twist his body and escape. His mind still wasn't completely clear. He needed time.

But Bavier didn't give him a chance to regain his senses and charged again. Having been caught off guard twice, Rian instinctively thrust his head forward first to deliver a counter. His head flashed with pain, but it wasn't as bad as the first and second times.

The two men glared at each other with their foreheads pressed together. Blood was flowing from both their noses.

Bavier couldn't control his anger. For someone aspiring to be heavy infantry, physical strength was as important as swordsmanship. Having never lost in wrestling before, just being pushed this far by someone should have raised Rian's value.

'Hmph. I can't let it end like that.'

Bavier smiled as he spoke.

"You're holding up pretty well? But are you okay? Your eyes look unfocused."

Indeed, Rian was dazed. In contests of strength, one had to match the rhythm of breathing to the opponent's reactions. It was like entering water and betting on who could hold their breath longer. With insufficient oxygen, his consciousness began to fade even while standing.

"Well then, shall we start using folding now?"

Rian gritted his teeth. Had he been fighting without using folding until now? As if to prove it wasn't a lie, tremendous power emanated from Bavier's body.

"Hahaha! This is way too easy!"

Bavier toyed with Rian at will. Like playing with a child, he lifted him up and put him down, swinging him left and right. With more than twice the difference in brute strength, technique became useless.

'You didn't think I'd end it just like that, did you?'

Bavier embraced Rian's chest and lifted him up. Applying pressure in that position, all the air was forced out of his lungs.

"Huk!"

The feeling of air being forcibly expelled from his body was extremely unpleasant, but it was nothing compared to Bavier's next technique.

Grabbing Rian's arm and slipping between his armpits, he attempted a standing submission hold on his lower body.

"Th-that's..."

The cadets looked on with bewildered expressions. Abdominal stretch. A technique also known as the cobra twist.

Of course, it was a wrestling technique. But successfully executing the technique on a standing opponent was difficult, so unless there was a significant skill gap, it was a technique used only for practice or play.

And this was exactly what Bavier had been aiming for.

Rian was caught in the technique with his side bent and arm raised. Even though it looked ridiculous, it wasn't a position where he could exert strength, so once caught, he couldn't move.

"Urrrgh!"

A groan escaped from Rian's mouth. With his muscles stretched to their limit, even a centimeter of movement by Bavier sent pain traveling up his spine.

Bavier turned toward where the cadets were, as if showing off Rian's pitiful state. It was humiliating, but he had no choice but to be dragged along.

"How about it? Should I break your back like this? Huh?"

Every time Bavier moved slightly, creaking sounds could be heard from Rian's spine. Satisfied, he turned his head toward Tess. He could see her trembling body with her lips bitten.

'I told you. You shouldn't underestimate me too much.'

He didn't even consider showing mercy to Rian to impress Tess. Women in love were single-minded - no matter how wonderful a man approached them, they could only see one person. To turn her heart, he had to make a complete mess of him and then remove him from her sight entirely.

"How about surrendering now? Or shall we play a little more?"

Rian didn't answer. His gaze was also looking at what Bavier was looking at.

'Tess...'

Tess looked like she was about to burst into tears at any moment. She was a righteous person. That's why the most frustrated person here wasn't himself, but Tess.

"Break it."

"What?"

Bavier asked back with a bewildered expression.

"I said it clearly. That you could kill me and it wouldn't matter. But I will never surrender."

"Hahaha! Hey, why are you always so serious about everything? This is just an evaluation. There's no need to fight with your life on the line. Besides, doing this won't make your humiliation disappear, right?"

Bavier led Rian around for another tour. He could feel the cadets' emotions. Someone felt fear, someone anger, someone pity. But he knew these were the gazes of the weak looking at the strong.

"Huh?"

At that moment, intense power was transmitted. Bavier looked back at Rian in surprise, as if bitten by a bug.

'Does he still have strength left?'

His face didn't particularly show strain. His pupils were just coldly dead as if time had stopped.

'Straighten the back. Straighten the back. Straighten the back.'

Rian's gaze was turned inward.

When the command to straighten his back was transmitted, his side miraculously began to slowly rise.

"Heh heh. Look at this guy?"

Bavier laughed as if it were ridiculous, but couldn't completely hide his nervous emotions. He was subtly drawing out his full power, yet still couldn't prevent Rian from moving.

'What is this? Why is this happening?'

Bavier clenched his teeth and flexed all the muscles in his body.

"Hrrrrrgh!"

And the moment he felt the reaction, his heart sank. It wasn't a mistake or negligence. Rian's upper body continued to rise, yet he truly couldn't stop it.

His heart beat rapidly and shivers ran down his spine. Something different from what could be called strength was lifting Rian up. A massive movement like the entire world pressing forward instilled in him a fear he had never experienced in his life.

Kuan's eyes watching this forgot to blink. This was it. The mystery of Divine Transcendence that could never be understood.

'This is impossible. How can this be possible? What exactly is moving?'

Rian wasn't in a position where he could exert strength. Yet he was rising while completely ignoring the principle of leverage. Therefore, it wasn't moving by force. Some rule of the world was lifting him up.

"H-hey! Wait!"

Finally, a desperate voice burst from Bavier's mouth. No matter how much force he applied, he was only being pushed back endlessly. As Rian's position returned, his body twisted bizarrely. Finally, the cobra twist was reversed and his muscles stretched to their limit.

"Aaaaagh!"

The cadets were stunned by the sight of the attacker screaming. Rian neither vented his anger nor mocked Bavier. Only the thought that he had to move his body existed.

"I surrender! I lost! Please stop! Not the back!"

Rian didn't stop. Even when Bavier performed his mocking display, he hadn't felt angry at all. He had long since discarded shame in the face of talent's limits.

But that's precisely why, to break him, the opponent also had to stake everything. And even if all of that was the petulance of someone without talent, making Tess angry was absolutely unforgivable.

'Right. This is enough.'

Rian finally made his decision. And he pressed down on Bavier's face caught under his armpit. A crunching sound of something twisting could be heard.

"Aaaaaargh!"

Bavier screamed as if his jaw would dislocate. With their bodies entangled, he couldn't even fall. As his abdominal muscles tore, all strength left his body, and he hung like a puppet with severed strings, only his mouth agape. Drool leaked out.

Rian grabbed Bavier's head caught under his armpit and pushed him away. Bavier, who had fallen to the ground, convulsed from the secondary impact. Tears streamed down his face, showing how much pain he was in.

In the lengthening silence, the cadets' expressions changed. In Bavier's crying figure, they couldn't find the aura of absolute strength they had felt just moments before.

'Poor bastard. It's vacation starting today, but looks like he'll be recuperating for three months.'

Bavier propped up his upper body with his hands on the ground. But he screamed and collapsed again at the pain he felt once more. Barely lifting his head, he shouted with venom.

"Don't think this will change anything! I'm just weak! You're not strong!"

His vicious nature could be felt in how he hurled abuse while degrading himself.

But Rian couldn't hear anything.

From the aftermath of Divine Transcendence that had forcibly moved his body, every muscle in his body felt like it was tearing.

'Damn. I overdid it.'

Rian counted to ten in his mind. In time with the count, the pain began to gradually subside. It was the tremendous recovery ability he had gained from breaking through his limits every single day without exception.

'Now I can move.'

As his hearing opened, Bavier's voice could be heard.

"You think this will work forever? I'll become stronger! But that's your limit. You'll live as a loser for the rest of your life!"

"That bastard...!"

Tess clenched her fists. If it hadn't been an evaluation, she would have rushed over and delivered another blow to his torn abdomen.

In contrast, Rian had a calm expression. Returning to his place, he slung his training clothes over his shoulder. Then, without a single word, he turned toward the training ground's exit and began walking.

"R-Rian?"

Not only Tess but other cadets looked at Rian with bewildered expressions. Kuan's cold voice struck his back.

"Rian. Sit down. Unauthorized departure means failure."

"Then make it a failure."

Rian couldn't find any difference between last place and failure. No matter what results he showed, the school wouldn't give points to a swordsman who couldn't use Schema.

As Rian left the training ground, the atmosphere grew cold. Since no cadet had ever shown such defiance toward Instructor Kuan, some were already praying for Rian's soul.

'Is this finally the limit?'

Kuan was neither displeased nor worried about Rian. As long as the cadets took responsibility for their actions, he didn't care whether they ruined their lives or not.

But today, his mood wasn't light. Divine Transcendence was a real power, and Rian could wield it.

Just how far could he endure? Someday, his body would be unable to withstand the power of his will and would be destroyed.

Kuan wrote "failure" on Rian's evaluation sheet and added parentheses. Then he added the words "unauthorized departure."

When the wrestling evaluation ended, Tess went to find Rian without even washing up. Just then, Rian was coming out of the dormitory door. Though he must have been burning inside, he had even showered and was neatly dressed.

"Rian! What's going on? Do you really want to fail?"

Rian strode past Tess with determined steps. He seemed to have made up his mind completely. That's why she was anxious. Once the fire started burning, it was Rian's nature to spread uncontrollably.

"Please say something. Leaving during an evaluation is serious. It's not about being last place. You know what happens when you get on the instructors' bad side?"

"It doesn't matter. Whether I get on their bad side or not."

While she could understand Rian's feelings of not receiving compensation for his efforts, this time the situation was truly bad. Insubordination against superiors was unacceptable under any circumstances.

"Rian. Think about it again. You've endured well until now."

"I'm not doing this because I can't endure it. I'm sick of it all."

The moment she saw Rian's distorted face, Tess realized he was serious. But what could be accomplished by doing this? Everything was progressing too quickly.

The place Rian arrived at was the instructor's office. When he opened the door and entered, Kuan was sorting evaluation sheets. Glancing at Rian as he saluted, he turned his gaze back to his desk with disinterest.

"What is it? Acting like that when you left."

"I came because I have something to say."

"Go back. You failed. A cadet who acts on his own whim isn't worth evaluating for skill."

Rian placed an envelope on the desk. Kuan frowned and looked up after confirming the writing on the envelope. But Rian spoke with a calm expression, as if he had already made up his mind.

"It's a withdrawal letter. I'm leaving the sword school."
