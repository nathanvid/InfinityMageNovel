"Ow!"

It was a snowball hard enough to make his skull ring. What's more, he was standing on slippery ice.

Unable to keep his balance, Jokre tumbled forward.

The absurdity lasted only a moment before anger surged up. What fearless person would pull such a prank?

"What! Who's there!"

Jokre touched the back of his head and turned around.

A gray-haired young man stood outside the skating rink, casually tossing snowballs up and down. In his other hand, oddly inappropriate for the cold weather, he held an iced coffee.

"No matter how unpopular you are with women, bothering a couple on a date is going too far."

Jokre narrowed his eyes at the familiar face.

Vivian muttered in surprise.

"That boy... that's Dante, right? Airhein Dante."

Dante entered the skating rink with his shoes still on. As he kicked off the ice and glided forward on one leg, Rudbans and Vivian unconsciously made way for him.

'My goodness. It really is Dante?'

Vivian couldn't believe her eyes even seeing him in person.

Ever since she had enrolled in magic school, he had been everyone's idol, never once losing his position as the kingdom's number one. That's why when news that Dante had lost to Shirone appeared in the academic journal, every student in the kingdom was shocked.

Jokre too had once scraped articles about Dante and pasted them in his notebook, burning with determination during his school days.

But how long would he remain bound by student memories?

Most of all, getting hit on the back of the head before even exchanging names was the greatest humiliation of his life.

"Hey, you..."

Dante ignored Jokre's words and approached Shirone.

"It's been a while, Shirone. Amy too."

Amy crossed her arms and glared at him.

"Oh my? Now you're just calling seniors by name?"

"Haha! We'll be in the same graduating class next semester anyway."

Amy wasn't really offended either.

During the 2,000-match competition, she had been treated with utmost respect as a senior, so this friendly attitude felt awkward instead.

But Dante's personality was truly cool - it seemed he had already erased such memories from his mind.

In any case, even if they were rivals at school, meeting fellow alumni outside naturally brought joy first.

Shirone smiled and said, "Seeing you in a place like this. What brings you here?"

"As you can see, I came to have fun. I travel every vacation. But this is my first time in Creas. Someone recommended the winter festival."

"I see. Did you come alone? What about Closer and Sabina?"

"Those guys went into special training as soon as vacation started. They're probably realizing what hell is right about now. They're such tiresome people to hang out with anyway."

As Dante shrugged, Shirone burst into laughter.

He had been having fun but was starting to think whether this was really okay. But seeing Dante's relaxed demeanor made him feel that his own burden was nothing at all.

'Dante really is amazing.'

Sometimes when recalling the 2,000-match competition, he would be startled by the fact that he had beaten Dante.

Beyond magic, he had star quality. The power to draw people's attention wasn't something you could gain through effort.

True to someone from the capital Bashka, he dressed well too.

Wearing a blue coat with black skinny pants and a purple scarf, he looked radiant without being flashy.

Moreover, he even had a piercing in one ear. From Shirone's perspective, being clueless about fashion, he couldn't help but be amazed.

But Jokre thought differently.

He had been completely ignored.

And in front of Amy no less. No, in front of Shirone, Amy's boyfriend.

What angered him most was how brilliantly Shirone, Amy, and Dante appeared to get along.

'So geniuses hang out with geniuses, is that it? Seeing them all gathered like this is really irritating.'

Jokre took a deep breath and spoke up.

"Hey, Dante."

"Hm?"

Dante turned around while biting his straw. He seemed to have completely forgotten what he had done just moments before.

"If you hit someone, shouldn't you apologize? Especially to a senior mage."

"Senior? Who are you?"

"I'm Jokre, an Eins Magic School graduate. I'm not in some promising position like you."

Dante blinked while sucking on his straw.

The longer Dante's silence continued, the more anxious Jokre became.

You could call it an inferiority complex and he'd have nothing to say, but he could picture what Dante might be thinking.

Of course, Eins Magic School was the alma mater Jokre loved, and he felt no shame in choosing to transfer.

But Dante was from the Royal Magic School no less.

The kingdom's most prestigious institution.

Though he now attended Alpheas Magic School to get revenge for his defeat to Shirone, that too was one of the five prestigious schools.

Most importantly, as the direct disciple of Olivia, a certified second-class Great Magician, there was no way he would notice someone like him.

"Sorry. I haven't heard that name. And wasn't it you who was bothering a couple having fun?"

"This...!"

Sparks flew from Jokre's eyes. The words "haven't heard that name" stuck in his chest like thorns.

Rudbans and Vivian, who had harbored some hope since their names were somewhat known in the minor leagues, also turned cold.

"Dante, don't get the wrong idea. Do you think you're something special? You're just a student after all. And you were thoroughly defeated by Shirone. That Shirone is a commoner. The Amy who was called a genius recognized by the world is ultimately just a repeat student."

"You really have it all memorized."

Dante said without changing his expression.

"That's the difference between you and us. We get published in academic journals, and you buy them to read."

Rather, Shirone's face burned hot.

If he himself liked cutting remarks, Dante mercilessly crushed his opponents' weak points.

It was cool if you could call it cool, but from the receiving end's perspective, it was hell.

As expected, the faces of Jokre's group contorted, and even killing intent could be glimpsed in their eyes.

If he had intended provocation, it had worked perfectly, but knowing that wasn't the case made him worry.

'Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!'

Jokre was dying of frustration. Why should he be treated like this?

Logically, the positions should be reversed.

The person who successfully graduated should be acting high and mighty, while those people should be looking at him with eyes of jealousy and envy.

'Hmph! Pathetic fools! Do you think your school's reputation will live your life for you?'

Jokre glared at Shirone's group and pondered how he could make them submit.

'Huh? What's that...'

Then he saw something glinting beneath Shirone's coat. Looking closer, it was a scabbard.

'Why is he carrying a sword at a festival? No, more than that, isn't he a commoner? Is he allowed to possess weapons?'

Jokre thought carefully about the reason. Then, realizing something, he burst into laughter.

"Puhahaha! So that's it, that's what it was. You're just the same after all."

As Jokre's personality suddenly changed, Dante backed away slightly as if frightened.

Regardless, Jokre pointed at Shirone.

"Acting all proud when you're soaked in inferiority complex! How desperate must you be for a commoner to carry a sword? Well, since your girlfriend is top nobility, you must have wanted to at least match appearances."

Vivian looked and made a surprised expression.

"Oh my, really? But isn't that illegal?"

"Of course it's illegal! Where does a commoner get off carrying a sword? And you think you can talk big after this?"

Jokre approached Shirone and threw open his coat.

Since it was a serious crime for a commoner to carry a sword anyway, his hands moved without hesitation.

Buttons tore as the coat opened, revealing Armang's silver scabbard at his waist.

"As I expected. How pathetic. Do you think this will make you a noble?"

Shirone's gaze grew cold.

"Step back. And compensate me for the coat."

Shirone desperately controlled his emotions. The monster inside, having caught the scent of anger, was trying to emerge again.

But having seized the upper hand, Jokre was busy with his own words.

"No decorations and so short - it's obviously cheap. Well, someone of your status, where would you get an expensive sword..."

Jokre reached toward the handle.

If it was short, the blade would be unsightly too. He planned to draw it and repay twice the humiliation he'd suffered.

But his thoughts ended there.

With a smooth whooshing sound, Jokre's movement stopped. Then his arms slowly rose.

His pupils trembled in shock, and his skin, feeling the chill, raised goosebumps.

"Th-this is..."

Rudbans and Vivian's faces were stained with horror. Shirone's sword had drawn itself and was thrust deep beneath Jokre's chin.

"Wh-what? How did the sword..."

Shirone was frowning fiercely.

Not because he was angry at Jokre. If his emotional control had been even slightly delayed, Jokre's head would already be rolling around on the ice.

'I was too complacent.'

Remote Control was a great function, but the problem was that the synchronization was so perfect it was even affected by the demon god's influence in the first layer of the depths.

Shirone was a mage who had trained his mind to never lose his cool in any situation. But that didn't mean he had no emotional changes.

The anger that surged through a moment's gap had made Armang emerge from its scabbard.

His disappointment in himself made Shirone angry.

As Armang trembled, sensing its master's anger, the sword's cry reached Jokre's eardrums.

Jokre ground his teeth and glared at Shirone.

"You...!"

"This is my final warning. Just go back. If you're rude one more time, I won't hold back either."

Jokre's legs, experiencing the pressure of death, lost strength and slipped back and forth on the ice.

At this rate, he would lose his balance and fall. Then Rudbans approached and supported Jokre from behind.

"Let's go back. We're official mages. If we cause trouble here, we're the ones who'll lose."

It was meant to save Jokre's face, but it was also realistic advice.

"Hmph! Arrogant brats! Let's see how well you do."

Jokre spewed curses until the end.

But since Rudbans was pulling him by the collar and dragging him away, he only looked more pitiful.

Only after Jokre's group had completely left the skating rink did Shirone sheath Armang.

"Hey hey, no matter how angry you are, you can't swing a sword around."

At Dante's words, Shirone's eyes grew sharp.

"That's ridiculous! This is all because of you! Why did you have to make that provocation! What about my coat! You're paying for it!"

"Buttons can just be sewn back on. But what's that sword you're carrying? Is that magic too?"

Amy looked around nervously and said, "Instead of that, let's move locations first. People are staring. The guards might come."

So far they didn't know Shirone was a commoner so they considered it just a minor incident, but if guards came and investigated, things would get complicated.

"Then shall we go into a cafe and drink coffee? Of course, since I helped, you guys are buying."

"Why should we buy you coffee when you're being so cheeky? And isn't what you're drinking now coffee?"

"This is iced coffee. So let's go drink something hot."

"You... are you perhaps a coffee addict?"

Dante held up his iced coffee and winked one eye.

"No. I'm a coffee enthusiast."

* * *

Shirone's group found a cafe called 'Cozy Tea House' in the shopping district and went inside.

As warmth reached them, their cheeks flushed red.

Shirone shivered as if shaking off the cold clinging to his clothes, then sat at a table and took out sewing supplies.

Dante took the menu.

"When you travel, you should try local specialties. Let's see, Ice Queen's Warm Coffee? Isn't that a strange name?"

Amy waved her hand dismissively.

"Pass on the weird stuff. I'll just have orange juice."

"Really? Then I'll have the Ice Queen's Warm Coffee. Shirone, what will you drink?"

Shirone focused on sewing the button and said, "I'll have warm cocoa."
