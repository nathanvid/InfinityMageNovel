Kariel's expression was ferocious, unbecoming of an archangel. His eyes flashed with murderous intent as if he had suffered an unbearable humiliation.

"How could the leader of the archangels do such a thing! In human terms, what's the difference between mating with a dog! And you're telling me to forgive that? Could you do it?"

Uriel could not answer.

In a sense, Kariel was like his own twin. Twin archangels born from receiving the source knowledge of Ikael, the first archangel.

However, their personalities were as different as the source concepts they were each granted. And above all, Kariel... truly loved Ikael.

Kariel returned his halo to its light form. But already hurt, he turned away coldly.

"If you have no intention of helping, then leave. I will definitely break through the Labyrinth of Time and Space. I will annihilate all those arrogant humans who defied the will of god!"

'...So petty.'

Uriel looked at his retreating figure with pity.

Though the wings of light, symbol of an archangel, spread brilliantly, in some ways he resembled humans.

Just like Ikael.

'I'm sorry, Ikael. But we... no, Kariel still needs you.'

Uriel placed his hand on Kariel's shoulder and spoke.

"I understand. I misspoke. I'll participate in what you're trying to do. So, I just need to smash this Heaven Explosion thing?"

Kariel pretended to be reluctant as he slowly turned around. But soon he regained his bright expression and continued explaining.

"Yes. But it really won't be easy. Even for you, it'll be questionable whether you can break it even with your greatest power. I've created a substance far harder than the hardest material in this world."

Nodding, Uriel walked past Kariel toward the Heaven Explosion.

When he arrived at close range, he could only see a black barrier. Looking at the molecular structure, it wasn't a substance created through heat and pressure. Probably an explosion. This would definitely not be easy.

"You should remember, Kariel. From very long ago."

Uriel changed his light form into a halo.

As information accumulated in the 4-meter diameter light wheel, a club made of light materialized beside him. It was 4 meters in total length, with the shaft being only 1 meter and triangular pyramid-shaped clubs filling the remaining length at both ends. It was a heavenly weapon called the Paradise Club.

"Among the things you've made, there's nothing I couldn't destroy."

As Uriel took a mounted stance and applied force, the Paradise Club spun rapidly, creating afterimages resembling a wheel. When the rotation speed exceeded Mach, the air made a sound like metal being cut.

Paradise Club Destruction Method - Heavenly Treasure Wheel.

(Changed Heavenly Galaxy Wheel to Heavenly Treasure Wheel ^^;)

"Uoooooh!"

Archangel Uriel was the angel of destruction. He possessed a source concept that mirrored Kariel, the angel of creation.

In the beginning, the world was born from some amplification. Then creation and destruction interlocked to create all things.

Kariel endlessly creates something, and Uriel destroys it. This was the fate of the two brothers born from Ikael, the archangel of amplification.

"Here I gooooo!"

As Uriel twisted his torso and swung his arm, the Heavenly Treasure Wheel, which had grown to 10 meters in diameter, moved along his forearm. Then as he bounced his body and swung his fist, the powerful wheel of light flew out and struck the Heaven Explosion hard.

Kuuuuuuuung!

A tremendous resonance filled the Great World War.

However, the Heaven Explosion didn't even budge, and only the Paradise Club that bounced off flew to the end of the Great World War before returning.

"Hah! Taha! Uoooooh!"

Uriel continued to crash the never-stopping Heavenly Treasure Wheel into the Heaven Explosion.

Kariel, who knew its power better than anyone, frowned with each impact.

'Tsk tsk, so crude...'

After about a dozen attacks, Uriel didn't throw the returned Paradise Club again. No matter how much he hit it, there was no sign of it breaking.

"Hmm, this one is certainly quite something."

Kariel smiled broadly as he consoled him.

"You don't need to overdo it. Even this much will cause tremendous shock to the Labyrinth of Time and Space. It's a shame I can't see that woman's terrified face directly."

Though meant to be comforting, it only stirred Uriel's competitive spirit.

Uriel swept his wings forward and retreated far back. After measuring the distance for a moment, he spoke.

"Stay back. This time will be different."

Kariel raised both hands as if to say 'go ahead and try,' then flew to the side of the Heaven Explosion.

"Fuuuuu."

Uriel took a stance like a heavy infantryman about to charge and exhaled deeply.

The halo expanded to 20 meters in diameter as destructive information began to accumulate. Golden sparks arose around the light wheel, causing the Great World War to tremble slightly.

Even Kariel couldn't bring himself to joke this time, looking worriedly around his laboratory.

"Uooooooooooh!"

Uriel charged toward the Heaven Explosion.

A Heavenly Treasure Wheel reaching 25 meters in diameter followed alongside him, increasing its rotation speed. The atmosphere of the Great World War was sucked toward the center of the wheel, creating fierce winds.

Uriel used all his strength to spin his torso 10 meters before the Heaven Explosion.

The Heavenly Treasure Wheel, tracing a curve, collided with the Heaven Explosion. The disc's afterimage disappeared for a moment as the Paradise Club embedded itself clearly into the surface.

But the rotational inertia was completely contained within the Paradise Club. The massive Heaven Explosion shook roughly, then white cracks began to spread across the black wall surface.

Kwaaaaang!

The Heaven Explosion shattered with a powerful explosion.

Though he had lost the bet again, Kariel's face was filled with ecstasy. Having Uriel destroy what he painstakingly created was the fate of their source concepts. Kariel had simply applied that fate to constructive purposes.

In any case, what mattered was that it was broken.

Also, by his calculations, it was sufficient power to destroy the Labyrinth of Time and Space.

* * *

The Labyrinth of Time and Space.

Miro had built a temple in a meaningless space where no end could be designated. It was an act of gathering vast emptiness to squeeze out a single meaning.

Because the temple existed, she existed, and based on that existence, she had erected a massive barrier between heaven and humanity.

In the vast temple, Miro existed alone.

Her biological clock had stopped long ago as she sat cross-legged in meditation. In new time and new space, she had inherited the fate of endlessly maintaining dimensional walls.

'What are you plotting, Kariel?'

There had been attempts to bypass the Labyrinth of Time and Space before, but lately the approach had been blatant. She felt cornered.

When heaven attacked, Miro blocked. Until now, there had been no problems. But now she had an ominous premonition that they were targeting something.

'What exactly are you thinking?'

A powerful shock struck the Labyrinth of Time and Space. Electromagnetic waves were generated, hardening the barriers of time and space. Miro's eyes snapped open.

Then second and third shocks followed.

As the Labyrinth of Time and Space shook, shock waves of the same intensity crashed into Miro's mind.

'They're directly striking spacetime. Is this a new technique?'

Even though humanity had advanced, they still couldn't catch up to heaven's technology. If it were them, they would have found a way to break dimensional barriers through mecha systems rather than magic.

Hastily kneeling, Miro formed complex hand seals. She crossed her left hand with index finger and thumb touching, and her right hand with middle and ring fingers pressed by the thumb, in a cross formation.

As she strengthened the dimension with Scale magic, the walls of spacetime began to thicken.

'This power... is it Uriel?'

Miro's face crumpled. Cold sweat flowed and her arms crossed in a cross began to tremble.

How much time had passed? Suddenly the shocks stopped.

Breathing roughly, she collapsed to the floor. Even though she had strengthened the dimensional walls, she wouldn't be able to endure in this state. A new method was needed.

"Kyah!"

As the Heavenly Treasure Wheel struck the Heaven Explosion, an unprecedented shock wave crashed into the Labyrinth of Time and Space.

As if struck directly, Miro flew dozens of meters as soon as the shock hit.

Even while sliding across the floor, she gritted her teeth and endured. Her eyes trembled in confusion.

This attack had cracked the Labyrinth of Time and Space.

'At this rate it'll break through. No, it's already broken through.'

Miro decided to deploy her last resort.

Sitting cross-legged with her fist floating above her palm, she slowly closed her eyes. There was no time to judge. If there was even a 10-second gap in the dimension, heaven's army would invade without any chance to defend.

'I enter samadhi.'

Once in samadhi, she couldn't escape on her own. It was a state of single-minded concentration where no thoughts could arise.

Though she needed to stay constantly awake as the sole master of spacetime, now was the time to fall into deep sleep.

Concentrating on concentration. Concentrating again from that concentration. Through this endless process, her ego became faint until finally no thoughts arose at all. Only the inertia of descending into the abyss remained.

What she gained in return was tremendous mental energy. The dimensional walls thickened infinitely and the cracks disappeared. This time, even Uriel would absolutely be unable to break it.

Though the temple's trembling subsided, Miro remained motionless, hardened like stone.

Having fallen into infinite concentration, she had forgotten her own existence. And unless someone came to wake her, she would remain in that state forever.

"What happened?"

At the top of the central control system, Kariel and Uriel were analyzing the results of this experiment. Kariel watched the screen with an intrigued expression.

Cracks had appeared in the Labyrinth of Time and Space. But they were quickly repaired before heaven could do anything. It showed how swift Miro's response was.

Most impressive was that as the Labyrinth of Time and Space was repaired, it became incomparably stronger than before. The durability readings transmitted on screen were enough to make even Kariel, an archangel, realize what a thrill meant.

"It's still getting stronger. What exactly did she do? Are these really numbers a single human can produce?"

Uriel drew a simple conclusion from the complex results.

"Did we fail?"

Kariel smiled bitterly.

"Still, we achieved some results. About 3 seconds by earthly standards. If we'd been 3 seconds slower, we would have completely broken it."

"I see."

Uriel didn't feel disappointed. Actually, he wasn't sure. Perhaps he was relieved.

"The Heaven Explosion technique itself can be considered successful. We just underestimated Miro too much. She's certainly a Nephilim worthy of representing earthly humans. How exactly did she strengthen it? Now ordinary Heaven Explosions won't even make a dent."

"Humans are strange. They seem infinitely weak yet can become infinitely strong. Guffin was like that. Miro is no ordinary human either. That may be why Ra blocked the approach."

"Hmph, they're still just humans."

Kariel didn't acknowledge humans.

They were unclear. Chaos itself. That's why Ra controlled their lifespan in the name of eternal life.

"What will you do now? The strategy to destroy dimensional walls has failed. It'll be harder to attack from now on."

Kariel wasn't worried.

"We can just find another method. What's more important is that cracks appeared in the Labyrinth of Time and Space. Interesting things will happen from now on. This will make for a good experiment."

Kariel pointed to the monitor. The Heaven Explosion experiment process was rendered as a 3D image.

Reference lines were drawn at specific points on a large sphere, then durability values appeared as numbers. When the Heavenly Treasure Wheel's shock was applied, cracks could be seen forming.

Such small cracks couldn't allow passage for heaven's armies or any living beings. But that only applied to living things.

In heaven's outskirts lived all sorts of strange existences that couldn't be defined by human standards. And right now, at this moment, something that had slipped through the cracks into the earthly realm was detected.

"What exactly is that...?"

Kariel couldn't answer.

Not that his knowledge was lacking. It was simply because whatever had gone to the earthly realm existed in an 'unknowable state.'

After the magic school graduation ceremony ended, Shirone took the carriage sent by the Ozent family and returned home.

Thinking about it on the way back, it had already been over a year since he enrolled. Though it was a short time in one sense, there had been far too many incidents.
