"So this is the Ice Queen. She's as beautiful as the rumors say."

"Eight hundred years ago was an era when magicians were condemned as witches. In a way, you could call her a tragic woman."

Amy briefly told the story of the Ice Queen.

The Ice Queen was originally a magician.

Since it was a time when divine authority ruled, she lived hiding her identity, but her beautiful appearance couldn't be concealed.

When word of the woman's beauty spread through gossip all the way to the royal palace, the old king summoned her directly. Smitten at first sight, the king made her his queen.

However, darkness was already growing in her heart after a lifetime of being pursued by the Holy Order.

Hundreds of innocent people died under horrific torture in the name of magical experiments.

As more people died, the queen's magical power grew stronger. As her magical power grew stronger, the queen went insane.

It's extremely rare for magicians to go insane. The profession itself strengthens the mind.

However, when the mind is destroyed for any reason, a situation far more serious than ordinary mental illness occurs.

As the mind and magic become synchronized, they lose control over their magical power.

Magicians called this phenomenon "magical unity."

The queen, consumed by madness, froze everything around her.

Her room, hung with icicles, resembled an ice cave in the Arctic.

Not only furniture like beds and dressing tables, but even the maids and servants attending to her froze to death.

When the situation became uncontrollable, the king built a small castle in Les Mountains and made her queen of that place. Though called a queen, it was no different from exile.

But even there, the queen's strange behavior didn't stop.

The first subjects of her experiments were dozens of servants. When they all died, she began capturing people and continuing her cruel experiments.

After a year passed, no one remained alive in the small castle in Les Mountains.

But the queen was satisfied. After long experimentation, she had finally reached the realm she desired.

"I shall sleep in a place where even time is frozen. When I return again, the world will kneel at my feet."

The queen cast her final magic, imprisoning herself in a massive block of ice.

This was the story behind the Ice Queen's final appearance that Shirone was now looking at.

"Hmm, I see."

Shirone moved a little closer to the Ice Queen.

After hearing the story, it felt real. Her appearance with closed eyes in hibernation truly seemed like someone from 800 years ago sleeping.

Amy concluded the story.

"Perhaps even in her destroyed mental state, she was tormented by guilt? That's why she devoted herself to magic that would freeze even herself."

"That could be. If it's true, it's really incredible."

A magician cannot die from magic they cast themselves.

While not theoretically impossible, casting magic to harm oneself required will that transcended omnipotence.

"Since magic won't activate if the Spirit Zone wavers, ordinary magicians couldn't even attempt it."

"Hmm, maybe it's closely related to the magical unity phenomenon?"

Shirone stroked his chin, lost in thought.

Amy burst into laughter at his unnecessarily serious expression.

"What's so serious about it? It's just a legend anyway. It's unclear if the Ice Queen even existed. There's even a theory that it was based on a violent queen of that time. What's trapped in ice now is probably just a wax doll."

Shirone also knew that the winter festival wasn't based on actual history.

"Yeah. But it looks really real."

Amy also acknowledged the doll's craftsmanship. Since it was the festival's centerpiece, it was natural they put care into it.

Shirone and Amy approached closer to examine the queen trapped in ice.

At that moment, the Ice Queen's eyes suddenly snapped open.

"Ahhh! What?!"

Shirone and Amy simultaneously embraced each other and stepped back.

At their screams, tourists turned their heads. But they soon realized what was happening and burst into snickers.

Realizing she was in Shirone's arms, Amy hurriedly broke free.

Her face red with embarrassment, she stomped on the innocent floor and shouted.

"S-stupid! There's a mechanism in the floor. When you step on it, the doll's eyes open."

"How was I supposed to know? And you were surprised too."

"Who was surprised? Your voice was just so loud. Really, men are such cowards."

Shirone pointed at Amy's pale face.

"Haha! For someone who wasn't surprised, your face is pretty pale?"

"...Oh really? Should I make your face even paler? If I make you vomit, you'll turn pale green like thin soup."

As Amy approached, cracking her knuckles, Shirone slyly averted his gaze and mumbled while looking at the floor.

"If you were surprised, just admit it. It's not like you're a thug..."

"What? Thug? Fine, I'm a thug. What are you going to do about it?"

Amy, making her fists pointy, jabbed at Shirone's ribs. Shirone, his ribs tingling, flailed his arms and ran down the corridor.

"Uhaha! Stop it! I said it tickles!"

"Where do you think you're going? Come back here!"

Their voices echoed through the hall.

The tourists didn't even pay attention.

This was a festival venue, and it was a perfect dating spot for couples.

However, three students from Eines Magic School couldn't take their eyes off Shirone and Amy after spotting them.

To be precise, they were graduates who had just passed their graduation exams.

Eines Magic School, one of the two magic schools in Creas, wasn't as prestigious as Alpheas Magic School, so it had lower recognition.

Most importantly, even after graduation, they couldn't automatically obtain a magician's license like graduates from prestigious schools.

Of course, in reality, most guilds would issue a magician's license just by submitting a diploma. But considering the privileges of prestigious school graduates, it was truly hurtful to their pride as fellow graduates.

"That couple over there... aren't they pretty famous kids?"

Rudbans gestured toward the railing with his chin.

He was tall and lanky with curly hair, wearing long sunglasses that made him look much more mature than his actual age.

"Oh my, you're right!"

Vivian also recognized Shirone and Amy at a glance. She was a girl who seemed to have a complex about her slightly drooping eye corners, as she drew her eyeliner more fiercely than others.

Like most magic school students, they too regularly subscribed to the Spirit academic journal.

While most of the pages were occupied by prestigious school introductions and students, the journal's sales were actually much higher among non-prestigious schools.

In the case of prestigious schools, there was no need to buy magazines just to read articles about their own schools or competing rivals.

"Arian Shirone and Carmis Amy. Oh? Come to think of it, Jocre, you must know Amy?"

"Of course I know her very well."

Jocre, the group's leader, twisted his lips.

Medium height with disheveled hair, narrow eyes, and thin lips that revealed his stubborn personality.

For Jocre, Alpheas Magic School was a painful past.

He had attended classes there until age thirteen before transferring to Eines Magic School.

The fact that he had confessed to Amy right before transferring and been rejected was a secret that even Rudbans and Vivian didn't know.

Of course, he hadn't transferred just because a girl rejected him.

When it came to the top five prestigious schools like Alpheas Magic School, it wasn't an exaggeration to say that the kingdom's greatest talents gathered there.

With ordinary talent, you'd only become fertilizer for the geniuses.

Jocre had thought he couldn't win the competition and sought a different path through transfer.

In fact, more than half the students who attended prestigious schools failed to graduate despite their age.

From that perspective, Jocre's judgment could be seen as excellent.

However, looking back at reality, it was extremely rare for students to transfer from prestigious to non-prestigious schools.

Prestigious schools had their own pride.

Taking a different path to avoid competition seemed like running away from the students' perspective.

Since they were all praised as geniuses before entering magic school, their sky-high self-esteem also played a part.

'Hmph! Prestigious schools and reputation are all just pretense. What good is pride when you can't produce results?'

Jocre had always thought that way.

But if asked whether he had no regrets about leaving the prestigious school, he honestly couldn't answer readily.

"My goodness. To think I'd see those kids here."

Vivian knew Shirone and Amy inside and out. She was confident that, limited to school life, she knew them in more detail than their families.

This was common among non-prestigious school students. The students featured in the Spirit academic journal were both their goal and idol.

"That boy is Shirone. The one who defeated Dante, who boasted an undefeated record. And there's Carmis Amy with her Insight too. I heard they're lovers - I guess the rumors are true."

The word "lovers" drove a nail into Jocre's heart. The fact that his heart still raced when seeing Amy despite five years passing made him even angrier.

"They're just students anyway. They fail graduation exams because they're obsessed with prestigious schools. How pathetic. No need to feel intimidated. We're official magicians."

Having said that, Jocre muttered to himself.

'Though the license hasn't come out yet...'

Anyway, he wasn't the snotty thirteen-year-old Jocre anymore. He had proudly graduated from magic school and was currently going through the procedures to become an official magician.

Meanwhile, Amy had spectacularly failed her graduation exam, so when would such an opportunity to lord it over her come again?

"Let's go. Since we met after so long, shouldn't we at least say hello?"

Rudbans, following behind Jocre with his characteristically expressionless face, added one more comment.

"From a senior's position, of course?"

Completely unaware that Jocre's group was approaching, Shirone was cornered at the end of the 1.5th floor corridor, being lynched by Amy.

"Ahaha! I got it! I was wrong! Stop it now!"

"How funny. This is just the beginning!"

Amy, in a playful mood, more persistently targeted the vital spots among Shirone's ribs.

Shirone's laughter exploded like bombs.

"Huh? That's a voice I've heard before."

A beautiful boy who had been touring the 3rd floor historical exhibition turned his head toward the railing upon hearing their voices.

From the high angle, he could see Shirone and Amy playing around on the 1.5th floor where the Ice Queen was displayed.

"Did they come on a date?"

It seemed Shirone had brought Amy to comfort her after she failed the graduation exam.

The boy watched that far, then turned around indifferently.

'Well, it's none of my business. Let me mind my own business.'

He naturally didn't care about other people's affairs, and especially wanted nothing to do with getting between men and women.

'Where's the antique exhibition?'

The boy disappeared into the depths of the exhibition hall, sucking on the straw of his iced coffee.

After finishing their scuffle, Shirone and Amy went up to the 2nd floor.

At the end of the collapsed castle wall, a rainbow bridge made of ice was installed to cross over to the opposite spire.

"Wow, it's beautiful."

Precise craftsmanship had gone into the railing decorations, and when standing at the center of the arch, the ice garden spread across the castle grounds came into full view.

After crossing the rainbow bridge to the opposite spire, they found a mini game area set up.

It was a game where you had to knock down soldier targets standing on the watchtower across the way, and the throwing weapons were snow that was scattered everywhere.

"Come on, come on! Give it a try. Ten snowballs for 10 silver. Knock down a soldier and win an Ice Queen stuffed doll."

After hearing the host's explanation, Shirone turned his attention to the Ice Queen doll in the prize corner.

It was a three-head-tall doll you could hold in your arms, smiling brightly with large, sparkling eyes.

It had a completely different atmosphere from the legendary witch in the story.
