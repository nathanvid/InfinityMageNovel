## [340] Wave of Law (5)

"Fire Call?"

Jokre swept his eyes across the direction from which the rock had flown. At a distance where Amy would be indistinguishable from the landscape unless looked at carefully, she stood there.

"How dare she look down on us?"

Jokre cast Teleportation and raised his Speed Gear to the 10th level. Amy hastily fired a Fire Call, but he easily evaded it since he could control inertia.

"Hahaha! Is that all you've got?"

The corner of Amy's mouth lifted slightly. The moment Jokre felt puzzled, dozens of Fire Calls poured down from the sky like rain, striking him hard.

"Gah!"

A curved shot at 88.97 degrees.

The Fire Calls that had been staying outside his perception suddenly plunging down at an angle—even Speed Gear couldn't block such an attack.

Amy didn't stop and charged at Vivian. Spirit's Radius provided a favorable environment for allies, but it had the fatal flaw of petrifying the caster. In the end, Vivian couldn't do anything and got punched in the stomach by Amy, floating up a full span.

"Urgh! Gah!"

As Vivian lay prone, vomiting up her stomach contents, Amy dusted off her hands and snorted.

"Hmph, you should be grateful that's all you got."

She wanted to teach them a proper lesson, but the situation wasn't exactly leisurely. While fighting Jokre's group, explosive sounds were erupting in the sky. It meant Shirone's specialty—firepower battles—had begun in earnest.

"Where's Shirone?"

Shirone was floating in the western sky. The Ice Queen was nowhere to be seen, but instead, clouds of cold air were gathering on the opposite side.

"Huh? That's..."

Amy's face froze in shock. The appearance of the Ice Queen revealed through the mist exceeded her imagination.

## Trinity (1)

Shirone swallowed hard with a stern expression.

As the cold clouds cleared, the Ice Queen's enormous eyes could be seen rolling around.

She probably wouldn't find him easily. Even humans had difficulty capturing objects smaller than their own pupils.

Things like dust, mosquitoes, or hair.

Honestly, he didn't know.

No, he didn't want to know either.

Watching eyeballs larger than a person, pupils, irises moving around at the same speed as human eye movements—it just made his mind go blank.

If the Ice Queen's pupils were human-sized, her face would be as large as a house. Cold air was seeping out between teeth arranged in neat rows dozens of meters long.

The fact that only her face had grown larger was the most bizarre part.

A massive face with a small body attached to it. If this were a dream, it would be the worst nightmare.

Why had she made such a choice?

If the plan was to startle him into cardiac arrest, it was a fairly decent strategy, but it certainly wasn't anything so primitive.

'She expanded her brain capacity.'

That was the only way to think about it.

For the first time, genuine emotion appeared on the Ice Queen's face, which had shown almost no change in expression.

Fear and rage.

Having experienced the crisis of annihilation from Photon Cannon's rapid fire, she had finally reached the most intense emotions humans could feel.

'Humans are strong.'

The Ice Queen realized this through Shirone.

'Then I shall become stronger.'

Shirone's strength came from his brain. So she just needed to become larger than Shirone. In some ways it was a crude method, but it was also the most intuitive and clear solution.

"Ooooooooh!"

Cold air spread from the Ice Queen's mouth. The air contracted, making it seem as if the entire sky was being squeezed inward.

The effects reached the ground. As the earth froze, the air cooled to the point where it was difficult to even breathe.

Dante and Liria trembled in the intense cold. Even the monsters with iron-plated skin were losing their mobility. Amy, who had Vivian's arm twisted behind her back, came running and shouted.

"Dante! What happened to that guy? If we don't hurry, we'll all freeze to death!"

Liria shook her head gloomily. The Ice Queen's transformation was bizarrely grotesque. Setting aside the power, it didn't seem like they could defeat such a monster. In that case, it would be better to trap the Ice Queen here, even if it meant dying in the process.

"Amy! Let Vivian go!"

Jokre and Rudbans, who had regained their senses in the cold, came running. But even they discovered the Ice Queen's transformation in the sky and stopped walking with blank expressions.

"What... what is that thing?"

The Ice Queen that Jokre knew was gone. Only a monster with a gigantic face was floating in the sky.

Amy held Vivian hostage in front of her and shouted.

"Now do you understand? What kind of monster you've awakened? So stop and surrender, and help us!"

Vivian struggled and said.

"As if! Jokre, attack!"

Jokre didn't move. No, he couldn't move. The temperature was dropping to a seriously dangerous level. Attack or whatever—at this rate, they would all freeze to death.

"Ugh! Stay still!"

"Kyah! Hey! Handle me carefully!"

Amy, unable to watch anymore, threw Vivian aside and moved to the center of the group. She cast Fire Wall, surrounding the area with a barrier of flames, and warmth was momentarily transmitted.

"Jokre! You do something too! Are we going to die like this?"

Jokre was also a fire mage. Coming to his senses quickly, he drew another barrier inside Amy's Fire Wall radius.

But it was futile. Fire created through omnipotence had a much lower ignition point than reality, but even that couldn't withstand it and was extinguished.

Extreme cold struck. Their lungs froze and their vision became dim. It felt like they were hurtling toward the end of the world, just like that day 800 years ago when the Ice Queen had frozen herself.

For the first time, Jokre felt the terror of death. His face turned into a crying expression as his death throes burst out.

"S-save me! I can't die like this!"

Rudbans grabbed his throat and fell to his knees.

"Urgh! I can't breathe!"

The current ground temperature was minus 120 degrees.

It was enough temperature to kill everyone in 3 minutes.

'Shirone, please...!'

Amy looked at Shirone with desperate eyes.

The only person who could endure the extreme cold was Shirone, who was protected by the power of Armament.

"Shirone! We'll all die at this rate!"

Armang's auditory organs collected Amy's voice and transmitted it to Shirone's brain.

But even without hearing it, Shirone already knew.

Despite Armang strengthening all the body's heat-generating organs, it was unbearable cold.

The heat consumption per second reached a whopping 1 kilocalorie.

Even the organic robe maximized for cold protection was hardening stiffly, so the people on the ground would already lack even the strength to move.

'Is there no choice but to clash?'

Shirone swept his Light Wings back and charged at the queen.

With the headwind added, the perceived temperature dropped even further.

It was tantamount to suicide, but Armang employed every available means to maintain body temperature without any complaint.

But eventually, even that reached its limit.

*—Biological tissue necrosis. Organic matter generation impossible. Life activity maintenance time: 4 seconds. 3 seconds. 2 seconds.*

"Graaah!"

Shirone gritted his teeth and charged forward. His entire body felt like it had turned into a cold stone.

And just as he was about to face his final moment in life, he plunged into the Ice Queen's mouth—the source of the cold air.

Amy shouted with a surprised expression.

"You're crazy! Shirone!"

Entering the Ice Queen's body was even more insane than taking the extreme cold head-on. It wouldn't just end with death. How could a human know what might be inside there?

Dante exhaled and said.

"Amy. The temperature is rising. Cast Fire Wall."

The Ice Queen who had swallowed Shirone didn't even blink. For unknown reasons, she seemed to be in a temporary state of suspended activity.

As a result, Shirone's judgment was excellent. That is, if he intended to save everyone by sacrificing his own life.

Amy's expression wasn't good as she cast Fire Wall. She already felt as if Shirone had departed from this world.

"He'll come back. Shirone will definitely come back."

Dante didn't give a hopeful answer. The probability of Shirone returning after throwing himself into an unknown world was incalculable.

"We've bought some time for now. I don't know how much leeway we have, but we need to do something within that time. Gather around, let's plan our strategy."

While Dante's group discussed strategy, Jokre stared blankly up at the sky.

'That is the Ice Queen's true form.'

The Ice Queen's giant face was horrible. It was as if someone from outside the world was shining a magnifying glass on just the face.

And Shirone had leaped into such a place.

Perhaps he could have endured a little longer. No, with his tremendous flying ability, in the worst situation he could have just taken his friends and fled.

But instead, he threw himself into mortal danger.

To save the world? To become a hero? If not that, was this also a manifestation of arrogance?

"Why?"

Jokre asked with sincerity, but Shirone, who should have answered, had already disappeared into the Ice Queen's law.

---

Shirone floated in the world of law.

Countless stars whose distance couldn't be measured were constantly twinkling and exchanging signals.

Light and darkness were 1 and 0. A binary signal system was executing the Ice Queen's law.

But it wasn't important information in the current situation.

The truly important information was that there was no air here.

*—Remaining oxygen consumption time: 2 minutes 37 seconds.*

Shirone felt a chill of fear. The time Armang had transmitted was literally his lifespan.

'Stay calm. If you get excited, you'll use more oxygen.'

He managed to regain his composure, but that didn't change anything.

Nothing existed except 1 and 0 signals. Therefore, he couldn't create variables to break through the situation either.

Would he die like this when the oxygen ran out? Would he become a corpse and wander the cold world forever?

Then the speed at which the stars twinkled suddenly accelerated rapidly.

It felt like ants that had been slacking off suddenly speeding up frantically when food fell to the ground.

Shirone felt his mind becoming hazy. The faster the stars became, the more distant his senses grew.

'Ah, I see.'

This was the law's digestive system.

If he hadn't been protected by Armang's law, he would have already been decomposed and absorbed into the Ice Queen's law.

Indeed, every time his mind wavered, Armang readjusted his focal point to maintain consciousness.

It felt like being bait thrown into the sea.

'Please hold on.'

Shirone prayed earnestly to Armang. He knew it was just a tool, but right now it was his only lifeline.

Armang held on well.

The reason it didn't tell him how much oxygen remained was because it judged that fear would worsen the situation.

He would have probably thought that way, but Shirone felt that was actually scarier.

'Oxygen consumption. Let me just know.'

*—Remaining oxygen consumption time: 2 minutes 1 second. 2 minutes. 1 minute 59 seconds.*

'2 minutes left in my life.'

He deliberately thought about it casually. Otherwise, his oxygen consumption rate would double.

Of course, he could last a bit longer by holding his breath, but from that point on, his life would really hit rock bottom.

He needed to find a solution while he still had some leeway.

"Gasp!"

Shirone exhaled precious oxygen.

Suddenly, a massive sound was heard. No, more precisely, it was a signal that formed a massive sound.

*Shake.*

Like bait that had been submerged in water coming apart when it met rough waves, Shirone's consciousness began to rapidly disintegrate.

*Decompose.*

'Urrrrrgh!'

Everything that had formed a unity was waving flags of independence and departing.

His consciousness grew distant. Armang was making desperate efforts, but eventually the Ice Queen's law began to erode his mind.

"Graaah!"

Shirone grimaced. The nerves around his eyes rose as his pupils began to turn black.

A tremendous explosion occurred in the 1st layer of the depths, pushing the Ice Queen's law outward.

Against the intruder that had penetrated his mind, Guffin's sealing formation opened, once again dragging out the Demon God.

*—Multiple mental entities detected. Engaging Overdrive.*

Armang discovered the only hope that could save its master and immediately connected with Behemoth.
