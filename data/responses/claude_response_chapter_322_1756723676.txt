title: Chapter 322 - Crack of an Instant (4)

During the journey to the top floor, Ordon's mouth never stopped moving. Most of it was trivial chatter, but Kang-nan matched his conversation without showing any signs of annoyance.

"What's the ratio of magic school graduates in Tormia?"

"Around 72 percent, as far as I know."

"Oh ho, similar to Yakma. Good judgment. School graduates are trustworthy. Street-taught ones only know one thing. Their adaptability is poor too—how could you use such people?"

Kang-nan felt irritated as someone completely unrelated to magic began interfering in Association affairs.

"But wouldn't their improvisation in real combat situations actually be higher?"

"Haha! Improvisation? That would just be underhanded tactics."

'Filthy bureaucracy.'

Kang-nan's lips twisted.

She wasn't a school graduate either. Then again, how could someone who only saw numbers on documents understand reality?

Opening the door to the reception room, Kang-nan surveyed the space and let out a sigh. Even though an envoy from another nation had arrived, the person staying on the same floor still hadn't shown up.

"Please wait here. I'll bring the Association President."

As if it were standard procedure, Kang-nan smoothed over the situation and closed the reception room door behind her.

From that moment, her pace quickened.

The menacing sound of high heels abruptly stopped. Turning precisely at a right angle, she knocked on the Association President's office door.

"This is Kang-nan. I'm coming in."

No answer came. Not that she expected one anyway. Kang-nan forcefully turned the doorknob and entered.

The room was filled with stifling heat and reeked of sweat. The sight of the man sitting on the sofa assaulted her eyes.

Not only was he wearing only boxer shorts that revealed every contour of his groin, but he had his legs spread embarrassingly wide.

The man had a cigar—the strongest kind, forbidden to mages—clenched between his teeth as he stared at the ceiling, his chest rising and falling as if he'd just finished exercising.

His broad chest and wasp-like waist were completely unsuited to a mage. His thighs were like rocks and his calves were sleekly defined.

But if other women saw this man's body, they would scream. As if hundreds of earthworms were crawling around, every part of his body was covered in scars without exception.

"What is it, mutt?"

Kang-nan's expression twisted savagely.

When the wolf tribe was annihilated and she wandered the world alone, meeting this man had given her a new life, but at times like this, he felt less like a benefactor and more like an outright enemy.

"What do you mean, what is it? I told you an emergency envoy was coming from Yakma. He's waiting in the reception room right now—what are you doing here?"

The man's head, which had been tilted back over the sofa, slowly rose.

Unlike his muscular body, his face was gaunt enough to make his cheekbones prominent. A scar ran vertically across his left eye, and his jaw, hidden by a beard, was also covered in wounds. It suggested how long he had endured hardships.

Mikea Gaold, President of the Tormia Magic Association.

He was a First-Class Archmage of the highest Red Line rank and one of the founding members of the Supernatural Paranormal Science Research Society at Alpheas Magic School.

"An envoy... came?"

"Don't you remember? I told you just an hour ago! Hurry up and go greet him."

Gaold fell into thought.

He had no memory of it. Lately, it seemed he was losing his memory more frequently.

What did it matter?

He bit down on his cigar and drew deeply. Then he spoke briefly.

"Don't want to."

Kang-nan closed her eyes. She had to endure.

Thinking of it as saving one pitiful wreck, she opened her eyes again and pulled out an official document stamped with the royal seal.

"This is a direct order from His Majesty Adolf. The matter is serious, so you're to cooperate regardless of circumstances. If you still refuse, I'll take legal action."

Gaold tilted his head back behind the sofa again as if he couldn't care less. Continuously puffing on his cigar, he spoke irritably.

"Damn annoying. They won't leave me alone for even a second."

"Envoy reception is a matter where every second counts as discourtesy. Please stop acting like an ugly duckling."

After finishing her words, Kang-nan rolled her eyes and muttered.

"Duckling..."

Gaold lifted his face.

"What did you say?"

"...I said stop acting like one."

"You said that a moment ago!"

"I was emphasizing."

Kang-nan adjusted her horn-rimmed glasses with a prim expression and walked to the wardrobe. When she personally took out the Association President's attire, Gaold had no choice but to slap his knees and stand up.

"Tsk! This better not be trivial. I'll beat you to a pulp."

He roughly wiped away sweat with a towel and changed clothes.

Throwing his cigar on the floor, Gaold left the room and strode toward the reception room.

When he opened the door, Ordon brightened and welcomed him warmly. His attitude toward the Secretary General and the Association President couldn't be the same.

After exchanging pleasantries, Ordon got to the point. Whether he was indeed the highest envoy, once he entered business mode, even his gaze changed.

An attendant brought a portable video recording device to the table. Then a small safe arrived, and Ordon personally unlocked it. Opening the safe revealed an Obscura B inside.

"Strange phenomena are currently occurring across the world, including in Yakma. Let's watch the footage first."

When the Obscura B was connected to the device, video appeared. The scenery of a regional city that still retained an ancient atmosphere emerged.

Gaold, who had been watching indifferently, suddenly showed interest, his eyes lighting up.

People with dozens of tongues writhing inside their mouths were devouring other people.

Following the screams, the defense corps was dispatched. However, when corps members bitten by the mutants underwent the same mutation, the situation spiraled out of control.

"This incident occurred in a region called Cuberin. We couldn't obtain footage from other countries besides Yakma. However, rumors suggest similar diseases have spread. Some regions report ghost sightings."

Gaold focused only on the video.

Eventually, the royal palace's special forces were deployed and suppressed the mutants. Some of the swordsmen were people Gaold knew by name.

Mages who collected samples cast massive flames and burned the entire village.

"We performed autopsies on the deceased immediately after the incident. Any mutation is based on existing properties. However, the mutations in the deceased didn't match characteristics of any creature here."

Gaold returned to his indifferent attitude. Then, as if uninterested, he yawned languidly and said.

"So what, are you saying this came from space?"

The footage Ordon had shown was likely Yakma's top-secret information. Showing it to a foreign mage and providing key intelligence meant they had something to gain as well.

There was no way Ordon, Yakma's finest diplomat, wouldn't notice Gaold's change.

But today he hadn't come to set up a negotiation table. This was a supranational matter, and nations worldwide were watching this meeting.

"Something seems to have gone wrong with... the Labyrinth of Time and Space."

A flash of light appeared in Gaold's eyes as he smacked his lips wearily. But it was only a momentary change, and he quickly returned to his composed expression.

"So what? What do you want me to do about it?"

"We'd like to investigate the Labyrinth of Time and Space. But as you know, it's only accessible through the Kingdom of Tormia... Of course, we're not asking for independent access. Valkyrie has already approved it."

"More precisely, Alpheas Magic School."

Gaold revealed his displeasure.

Even having become a wreck whose memories disappeared constantly, there were memories he could never forget. Memories as vivid as reality were still masochistically whipping Gaold's mind and body.

Gaold leaned back and crossed his legs. Manners were no longer in his head.

Kang-nan's sigh could be heard. But he didn't care about that either.

"I'll think about it. Go back for now."

At this unexpected response, Ordon's expression changed to bewilderment.

"You'll think about it? Do you think I came here to ask you a favor? This is cooperation between nations. I understand His Majesty Adolf has already given consent..."

Gaold's facial muscles contorted abnormally. As if a demon's soul had possessed his face, two extreme expressions appeared simultaneously.

"Did you think I'd wag my tail if you invoked the king's name? Adolf? What's that bastard to me? Nobody goes without my permission."

As the air heated up, furniture in the reception room began to shake. Mental waves generated by the collision between his murderous intent toward Ordon and his effort to suppress it were moving objects.

This was willpower far beyond human limits. Even Kang-nan couldn't intervene this time and swallowed hard.

Ordon saw hallucinations.

The reception room disappeared, and while only Gaold and himself sat facing each other, everything around them was covered in hellfire. He could smell sulfur, and beyond the walls of fire came the screams of demons.

What kind of life had this man lived? He'd met countless people considered ruthless, but this was the first to make him freeze with terror.

'They said Tormia's Magic Association President was a madman...'

He understood why Kang-nan hadn't been expelled from the Association despite beating up numerous nobles. The head of the Association was an unparalleled lunatic himself.

"Get lost. Before I kill you."

This was a man who called his own country's king "that bastard." Realizing there wasn't an ounce of falsehood in Gaold's words, Ordon screamed and fled the reception room as soon as the hallucination ended. Urine running down his pants trailed across the floor.

Since what had happened couldn't be undone, the reception room was enveloped in heavy silence.

As Gaold's murderous aura subsided, Kang-nan sat in Ordon's place and spoke.

"Did you need to go that far? You could have sent him away with kind words."

"Annoying bastard. You enjoyed it too."

"Well... I can't deny that."

Gaold pulled out a cigar from his chest and bit it. When he snapped his fingers, a flame flickered to life and lit it.

Gaold was the only one who could use magic in the Association where magic control devices were operating.

"Investigate the Labyrinth of Time and Space? They might as well stick their necks out and ask to have their heads smashed."

"But what really happened? If there's a problem with the Labyrinth of Time and Space, abnormal phenomena should appear in Tormia first."

"Probably so. It just hasn't materialized yet. The place where those tongue monsters appeared was called Cuberin, right? It's where an ancient colosseum used to be."

"What does that mean?"

"They're not creatures. More like... concepts, I'd say. The hypothesis would be that those concepts crossed over and settled in areas where human thoughts are concentrated."

Kang-nan nodded obediently.

If Gaold said so, then it was so. No leader in Valkyrie knew as much about the labyrinth and heaven as Gaold did.

"Why would such phenomena occur?"

"Creatures couldn't cross over. The most likely assumption is that cracks above a certain level appeared in the Labyrinth of Time and Space. Miro could probably repair that much. But it won't last long."

Gaold leaned back against the backrest and moved the cigar from his mouth to between his fingers. Acrid tobacco smoke filled the reception room.

"Kang-nan, you'll need to go."

Kang-nan straightened her back and placed both hands on her knees.

"Give me your orders."

"Similar incidents will occur here soon. Investigate everything. Focus especially on places where ancient thoughts might gather. Places like ruins, colosseums, castle sites."

After writing Gaold's orders in her notebook, Kang-nan shot up from her seat toward the door. If it was a solo mission, there was no need to arrange a carriage, so she wouldn't be late no matter where in the kingdom an incident occurred.

"Oh, and while you're traveling around, stop by Creas too."

Kang-nan, who had been about to leave through the door, turned around.

"You mean where the magic school is? Do you have a message for Mr. Alpheas?"

Gaold tapped the sofa, lost in thought.

It might be a bit early, but if there was a problem with the Labyrinth of Time and Space, there was no time to delay. It was time to execute the plan he'd devoted his life to.

"Meet a child named... Shirone."
