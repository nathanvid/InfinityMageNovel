# [334] A Midwinter's Night (5)

Shirone gripped Amy's hand firmly.

"Amy, you're strong. Stronger than anyone I know. You'll definitely find a solution. You always have until now."

Amy turned to look at Shirone's face. The moment their gazes collided, it felt as if electricity flowed through her body.

The moonlit scenery, the sounds carried through the walls, Shirone's touch transmitted through their joined hands—all of it made her heart race.

As if the moments just before when even meeting eyes had made her shudder were all lies, hot courage welled up in both their hearts.

*'Shirone...'*

Amy had to make a choice.

Once again, she was given a hellish year's time.

Having already experienced defeat once, all she needed to focus on was achieving mastery in magic.

But never before in her life had she wanted so desperately to rely on someone, to lean on them.

She had neither the strength nor the confidence to overcome this alone.

Even in this moment of flowing silence, Shirone was looking at her with an unwavering gaze.

She had to cross a river of no return.

If she averted her eyes even here, Shirone would surely leave her side.

To avoid losing Shirone, she had to accept.

Amy thought she had finished steeling her resolve. But at the same time, new hesitation rose like a tide.

Selfish thoughts.

Would it be greedy to hope that he would remain by her side as before, even if she chose nothing, even if she coldly pretended not to know?

*'Just one year... Can't you give me just one more year? Until I can make a careful decision, can't you stay like this until then?'*

Amy slowly withdrew her hand. If this would disappoint him, it would have been a hand she could never have pulled away.

Amy felt mockery rising in her heart.

*'What? Finished steeling my resolve? Liar.'*

She knew the truth.

Shirone would wait for her.

Even if she was called selfish, it couldn't be helped. Amy couldn't give up either the graduation exam or Shirone.

"Thank you, Shirone. I'm glad you're here."

Having spoken those words, Amy wanted to hide somewhere.

To think that after all that careful consideration, this was such a half-hearted response.

But Shirone smiled gently with exactly the expression Amy had hoped for.

"That goes for me too. Let's work hard together."

Shirone gave Amy's shoulder a firm squeeze before returning to his spot and laying out his sleeping bag on the ground.

Amy felt relieved. It was as if she had returned to a past where the events of moments ago had never happened.

But the look in Shirone's eyes captured by her Insight reminded her sternly that it had all been reality.

How long would he be able to wait for her?

Self-contempt and feelings of guilt toward Shirone tangled together in Amy's eyes.

## Past Midnight

Jokre's group was quite drunk.

Still not satisfied, they bought large bottles of alcohol and snacks from a shop and settled in an open area around the castle walls.

Jokre opened a bottle of strong whiskey and poured it into the glasses set before Rudbans and Vivian.

Finally filling his own glass to the brim, he didn't even make a toast before gulping down the alcohol.

"Ugh, that's really strong. What's wrong? Aren't you going to drink?"

Rudbans asked worriedly.

"Aren't you drinking too much? What about tomorrow?"

"Tch, if my stomach hurts I'll just hole up in the lodging."

Vivian, who had barely touched the glass to her lips, looked up at the night sky.

"Sigh, even after graduating, it's nothing special. Before graduating, I really thought I'd be able to have amazing fun. Not even any guys are interested."

Jokre pointed his thumb at himself.

"We're guys too."

"Oh please, spare me. You're going to hit on me with that face?"

"Haha! Vivian, you're not exactly pretty either."

Rudbans agreed.

"Right, to be called pretty you'd need to be at least like that Amy from earlier."

Jokre's expression crumpled badly.

"Damn it! I'm thinking about it again! How dare they look down on us? When they haven't even graduated yet!"

"But hey, did you have some history with Amy? There was no need to chase them all the way to the skating rink. Those kinds of petty actions are what make them look down on us."

Vivian also waited for an answer, looking curious.

Certainly, Jokre at the skating rink had seemed more agitated than usual.

Jokre had planned to take the incident from when he was thirteen to his grave. But once alcohol entered his system, his mouth began to itch.

In truth, it was nothing much for others to hear, but for the person involved, it had been unbearable humiliation.

"I confessed to Amy right before transferring to Eins Magic School."

At the unexpected words, Vivian made a fuss.

"Oh my, really? So? What happened?"

"She said no."

"No, no?"

"Right! She said I was disgusting! Not 'I'm grateful but,' not 'You're a good person but.' It wasn't even the lie about having someone else she liked. She just said no!"

"Oh my, how awful!"

"How arrogant."

Vivian and Rudbans each threw in their comments.

Jokre trembled with clenched fists as he recalled that time.

"You know what was most infuriating? My response back then. I said, 'Okay, sorry.' I'll never forget that humiliation for the rest of my life."

Vivian clicked her tongue.

"Those pretty-faced kids only care about themselves, I tell you. Hey, hey! Actually, it worked out well. What's the big deal about that girl? We became mages. Jokre! You won! Come on, drink."

Jokre downed the entire drink Vivian poured for him. His throat felt like it was burning and fire erupted in his stomach.

But he felt okay. It seemed that friends were the only people he could truly rely on after all.

What did it matter if it wasn't a prestigious school?

Having met people who understood him, he had no regrets or resentment.

Jokre's group used his tragic past as drinking snacks, passing around their glasses repeatedly.

Soon the world began to spin.

The winter wind howled like ghosts as it passed over the snowy plains.

Before long, no one spoke up.

They all knew it—no matter what comfort was offered, the truth would not change in the end.

Jokre could not beat Amy.

## The Reality of Magical Society

Vivian leaned back and braced herself against the ground. Her eyes gazing at the sky were already unfocused.

Hot breath escaped her lips.

"Well, that's how it is. Alpheas Magic School is one of the kingdom's five prestigious schools, and just graduating guarantees employment at least in public institutions."

Jokre and Rudbans agreed in silence.

Just because you became a mage didn't mean everyone competed for jobs under the same conditions. While noble hierarchies and connections couldn't be ignored, since it was a merit-based society, treatment varied starkly according to one's background.

Anyone working in magical society knew that the competitiveness of prestigious schools versus ordinary schools differed greatly.

So different treatment was only natural.

Rudbans said, "Anyway, we graduated from magic school and became mages. That's pretty impressive too. The world is full of mages who couldn't even graduate school but act up after learning a single spell."

Whether you graduated from school or joined a guild, the certificates issued were unofficial, so there wasn't much difference.

The reason students still desperately pursued schools was to inscribe a single line with the school name in the background section of their certificates.

In reality, mages with guild names inscribed in their background sections had dropped to a level that Jokre's group could look down upon.

But such facts provided no comfort.

Above school graduates were prestigious school graduates. And their ultimate goal was official mage certification.

Guild mages were also treated as professionals since they made money through magic, but the kingdom's standard for recognizing someone as a mage was ultimately whether they had obtained official certification.

But official mage status wasn't something just anyone could achieve.

As one of the kingdom's five major examinations, the competition was enormous, and all the skilled mages from across the nation gathered there.

The typical course was: admission to a prestigious magic school, advancement each year, passing graduation exams, taking the official mage examination, and passing. Only by following this path could one be treated as an elite in magical society.

So Jokre's group, starting from a different point, couldn't gloat about being merely above guild mages.

Jokre grabbed the bottle and drank directly from it while shouting, "Damn it! What do we care whether others get certificates from guilds or not? Once we enter the workforce, we're all mages anyway. Besides, our supervisors will be from prestigious schools. Look at Dante. Even when he was at Royal Magic School, he was supposedly crushing professional mages."

"But that's just gossip written in academic journal submission columns."

Jokre's tongue was getting increasingly twisted.

"Whatever. It's all the same anyway. We have to compete with résumés against kids from the kingdom's five prestigious schools. Would major association organizations hire us? Besides, we're not high nobility either. In the end, we'll become 9th rank while being lackeys to others, work like dogs to become 8th rank, and after about ten years? All the prestigious school graduates will already be 6th rank sitting in management positions."

Though these were words spoken while drunk, they weren't lies. Finally accepting reality, Vivian nodded.

"Right. And prestigious schools aren't the end either. The kids who graduate with top grades from there rise to 6th rank within 2-3 years. What exactly are we supposed to do?"

Jokre gestured wildly as he spoke.

"You know what's even more annoying? Those geniuses eventually become teachers and get appointed to prestigious schools. It's hereditary talent. Genius teachers teach, so geniuses come seeking them. In short, we can't even dream of fitting in there."

Though Jokre's words were beginning to include some exaggerations, overall they weren't wrong.

Of course, among ordinary school graduates, there existed those who had risen to the highest positions in magical society.

But such outliers inevitably lost their significance before the magic of averages.

Ordinary school graduates were inferior to prestigious school graduates in ability.

This alone was the established theory the world recognized.

## Life as a Play

The pessimistic stories that spilled from Jokre's group's mouths didn't drift away on the wind but continued to circle around their drinking spot.

During their student days, they had thought it didn't matter as long as they became mages. But once they actually became mages, their desperate desires vanished like mirages and new worries arose.

Vivian, who had been gazing at the stars, suddenly voiced a thought that occurred to her.

"Have you ever thought about this? What if this world is like a play? We're living our lives, and someone is watching us."

Jokre and Rudbans turned to look at Vivian.

"If that's the case, I would definitely not be the protagonist. The audience would never wish for my success. They probably wouldn't even be interested. They'd think, 'Just exit quickly,' or maybe even, 'I wish she would just die.'"

Jokre looked at Vivian with pity.

She had been a sensitive friend since childhood. But what was truly heartbreaking was that her current statement wasn't just from being drunk.

Perhaps her words might be the correct answer.

"Why worry about such things? Life isn't a play. Nobody knows. And no one thinks badly of you."

"But that's how it is, isn't it? Shirone, Dante, Amy. Do kids like them know how much we wanted to be like them? They probably don't. They just hang out among themselves. Maybe there was never a place for us to fit in from the beginning. Like extras in a play."

The atmosphere at the drinking gathering became extremely depressing.

Jokre especially couldn't bear how pathetic he felt for being unable to refute Vivian's words.

"Damn it! What is this! This is supposed to be a graduation celebration trip! We passed! We became mages! We won! Just because we had to run into those unlucky bastards!"

Jokre stuck the bottle's mouth into his own and blew like a trumpet. The strong alcohol flowed down his throat without leaving a drop.
