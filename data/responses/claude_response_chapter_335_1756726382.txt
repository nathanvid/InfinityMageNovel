[335] A Midwinter Night (6)

4 AM.

The Ice Queen's castle.

A brown liquor bottle shattered against the castle wall.

"You bastards! Come out! Come and fight me!"

Drunk Jokre was screaming at the top of his lungs. His pupils were completely dilated and his steps swayed in zigzag patterns.

Rudbans and Vivian supported him from both sides.

"Jokre, stop it. What if we get caught? We're not supposed to be here at this hour."

His melancholy mood had transformed into rage through intoxication.

Jokre needed someone to fight, and his fighting spirit against the world eventually drove him beyond the restricted area.

"Haha! Who's going to touch me? I'm a mage! A certified mage! Come on! I'll blow away guards with a single spell!"

Jokre shook off his friends as he thrashed about.

Vivian and Rudbans couldn't stop him. They didn't know how much he'd drunk, but they were also in a state where their minds were coming and going.

At least Rudbans, who wasn't as belligerent when drunk, clung to Jokre again and guided him inside the castle.

"It's cold. Let's go inside first. If we keep making noise here, we'll be in big trouble."

"Alcohol! Rudbans! Let's drink! Let's drink to our heart's content!"

"Fine. So be quiet and follow me."

The hall, emptied of people, was desolate.

The furnishings that they had passed by carelessly during the day were now emanating an eerie feeling as if they had come to life.

The Ice Queen's figure, illuminated by the cold moonlight streaming through the windows, was particularly spine-chilling.

Vivian rubbed her shoulders and said.

"Some lighting magic, please."

Jokre wasn't in any state to cast magic, so Rudbans and Vivian cast lighting spells.

But since they were also drunk, they only succeeded after several trial and error attempts.

With a popping sound, two lights rose to the ceiling and the hall instantly brightened.

Jokre crawled up the slippery ice stairs.

Entering the corridor on the 1.5th floor, he picked a fight with the Ice Queen's wax figure trapped in giant ice.

"Hey, Ms. Ice Queen? Are you sleeping? Want to drink with me?"

There was no response.

"Haha! See! Even legendary mages are nothing special. At most, you're just sleeping trapped in ice! Is that even magic?"

—Magic. The law that overturns phenomena. Ice Queen. Mage.

The mental entity absorbed Jokre's information.

Obtrus, materialized by Liria's necromantic soul summoning, instinctively fled to the place where the most familiar thoughts were concentrated.

That place was the Ice Queen's castle.

Among the information tourists spouted, the Ice Queen occupied the largest portion.

Obtrus was rapidly adapting to this world based on countless pieces of information.

After passing a certain point, cognition arose in the mental entity that had only possessed sensation.

As sensation and cognition communicated with each other, simple preservation of knowledge began to transition into the stage of thought.

—I think, therefore I exist.

Obtrus reached the conclusion that it needed a form to prove its existence. And it found a special vessel that could materialize its thoughts.

The Ice Queen suddenly opened her eyes.

Jokre wasn't surprised. He knew that the eyes would open when someone stood on the wax figure's platform.

The Ice Queen's beautiful appearance made his wounds, carelessly discarded by women, throb even more.

Jokre knocked on the ice as if knocking on a door.

"Hey, Your Majesty. Want to date me? Huh? Hehehe."

Vivian clicked her tongue while looking at Jokre's drunken behavior with disdain.

"He's completely lost it. Hey, get a grip. If you lose consciousness here, you'll freeze to death."

Jokre rolled up his sleeves and took a fighting stance against the Ice Queen.

"Alright, let's fight. A battle between mage and mage. But if I win, you have to date me."

As all the information collected so far was categorized as experience, Obtrus reached the stage of judging the world by its own standards.

—What is strength? The superiority of certain characteristics. Control of properties. Alteration, transformation, and change of the physical world.

Then suddenly, one question arose.

—Then... am I strong?

"That's enough now. Let's go back. Let's get some sleep too. How long are we going to stay here like this?"

Seeing Jokre's eyes half-closed, Rudbans hugged him from behind and dragged him away.

Vivian, who had been sighing with her arms crossed, glanced at the Ice Queen and followed behind Rudbans.

And the moment she took a step, she turned her head as if it would break, her face filled with horror.

"Uh, uhh?"

The Ice Queen's eyes, which should have been looking straight ahead, were looking at her.

Vivian thought she wasn't sober yet.

But no matter how much she gathered her wits, the Ice Queen's gaze was clearly turned to the side.

She felt her hair stand on end. Her heart pounded as if it would burst, causing shock.

"H-hey, guys..."

Jokre's voice grew distant down the stairs.

"Mmph, let's date... mm?"

Don't leave me behind!

Vivian was paralyzed with fear and couldn't make a sound.

The Ice Queen's gaze, which was definitely made of wax, was now moving freely and looking around.

It seemed like she was analyzing what material was imprisoning her.

Vivian felt like she was dying even though nothing hurt.

No, it was even more terrifying than dying.

As she thought the distance from her friends was growing with each passing moment, her desire to live pushed air into her stomach.

Vivian screamed at the top of her lungs.

"Ahhhhhhh!"

The hall echoed thunderously with her scream.

The moment Rudbans, who had been going down the stairs, turned his head with a surprised expression, light flashed from where the Ice Queen was.

"What?"

Rudbans let go of Jokre and climbed the stairs.

The Ice Queen was surrounded by brilliant light, and pale-faced Vivian was watching it with her jaw trembling.

"R-Rudbans... this, this..."

The Ice Queen's wax skin was cracking and light was leaking through the gaps.

As her body vibrated, the ice block cracked and split into thousands of fractures as if it would explode at any moment.

'I have to get away. I have to get away...'

The ice block exploded with a roar. At the same time, Rudbans grabbed Vivian and threw himself.

Ice fragments scattered to the end of the hall.

Jokre, who had been on the stairs, hastily covered his face as fragments flew toward him. Then he looked up with a surprised expression.

Even as Vivian hit the ground hard, she couldn't take her eyes off the Ice Queen.

Inside the shattered wax figure was a golden burning phosphorescence.

It slowly walked over and approached the railing.

As the light gradually subsided, an Ice Queen appeared with incomparably more vitality than before.

Vivian muttered in disbelief.

"The Ice Queen... has been resurrected?"

Having witnessed the Ice Queen's resurrection from closest range, she clearly saw the wax skin break like a mold and a new Ice Queen fill the inside.

Jokre, who had reached the opposite corridor, tried to run to Vivian but hastily stopped.

Like Vivian, his face also turned pale.

"Ice Queen?"

Were the legends true?

If the current situation wasn't a dream, he was now confronting the mage who had driven countless people to their deaths.

"Haaaaah."

The Ice Queen opened her mouth and exhaled air. Frost leaked out and the atmosphere began to freeze solid like thin ice.

"This is the freezing phenomenon."

It was a beautiful voice.

But Jokre, who met the Ice Queen's lifeless eyes, felt the blood flowing through his veins freeze.

The Ice Queen, who had been examining Jokre with indifferent eyes, said.

"If you defeat me, I shall do it—this thing called romance."

"Ugh... Ahhhhh!"

Jokre's nerves raced toward death.

Conversely, his desire to live instantly eliminated the alcohol's effects and deployed the magic he had trained longest.

A fireball was born above his palm.

Jokre's specialty was close-range flame magic.

While not particularly fast in firing speed, he was confident that its power was second to none.

"Jokre! Don't do it!"

Vivian screamed. From a third party's perspective, it was utterly reckless behavior.

But if she had actually made eye contact with the Ice Queen, she would have been forced to do exactly the same thing as Jokre.

"D-die!"

The fireball Jokre threw scored a direct hit on the Ice Queen's head.

No, it seemed she had no intention of dodging from the start. With a bang, everything above her neck burst into flames.

"Kyaaaahhh!"

Since it had originally been a wax figure, Vivian, who imagined a human candle, screamed.

Anyway, the water had already been spilled.

Rudbans, who was at least rational, cautiously observed the Ice Queen's movements and muttered.

"Is she dead?"

The Ice Queen didn't even twitch. All her nerves were concentrated in her brain.

The sensation she was experiencing for the first time since gaining form was interesting.

Since she had transformed the law into biological form, the pain of her face burning was terrible.

But to her, who couldn't clearly define pain, the sensation was merely an abnormal sensory state.

'Is this heat? It absorbs energy to suppress it.'

As she absorbed energy through the law, the fire instantly disappeared and the surrounding atmosphere froze.

The Ice Queen's hideously distorted face was revealed.

Jokre, who had caused this, felt his legs go numb and ended up falling on his bottom.

"Ugh, p-please spare me..."

The Ice Queen savored the nervous system in her face having convulsions.

Pain was truly an unpleasant sensation.

'The brain...'

The Ice Queen's face began to regenerate bit by bit as she approached Jokre.

"It almost melted."

If the brain melts, one dies.

That is life.

"Please spare me! I was wrong!"

Jokre prostrated himself flat and begged for his life. Fighting a mage who remained alive even after having her face burned was insane.

"Jokre!"

Vivian and Rudbans ran over and blocked Jokre's front.

Though they couldn't possibly be a match for the Ice Queen either, Jokre felt his friends protecting him were like saviors.

Vivian knelt and pleaded.

"Please spare us! My friend did that because he was drunk! He never intended to challenge Your Majesty."

"Drunk?"

Alcohol. Brain. Disruptive substance.

"I see."

Learning that the reason she had been caused pain was due to a brain-disrupting substance, the Ice Queen lost interest.

"Absorbing something called alcohol doesn't seem particularly beneficial for living beings."

"Yes! Yes! We're sorry."

"Then what will you do now?"

The Ice Queen asked with pure curiosity.

She had been born as a human and met humans. Then she was curious about what these beings would do to her.

Since purity and madness had something in common, the Ice Queen's honest question came across as terror to Jokre.

"We'll do anything you command. So please just spare our lives."

"You'll do what I command?"

"Yes, anything..."

The Ice Queen tilted her head.

"Why?"

Jokre looked up at the Ice Queen with bewildered eyes.

Coming to his senses, he thought her manner of speaking and behavior was strange.

But if the legends were true, she had been dormant for a full 800 years. There was a strong possibility she had lost her memory.

"N-naturally, because Your Majesty is the ruler. You're also a great mage. So you should rule again."

"Rule?"

The Ice Queen's head tilted further. Then, as if something displeased her, she frowned.

Though she had gained individuality by borrowing human form, her information processing speed had dropped dramatically.

But even such neural inconsistency was merely accepted as a characteristic that living beings possessed, not as displeasure.

"I see. I rule. Because I am strong."

Jokre let out a sigh of relief.

As expected, the Ice Queen was the Ice Queen. If he had tried to be clever, he would have surely lost his life.

"Your words are absolutely right. We're on a completely different level from weaklings like us."

Jokre bowed endlessly.

This was the point where he had finally achieved his first success after a lifetime of effort.

If he died a meaningless death in a strange place before even getting to enjoy life as a mage, he wouldn't be able to close his eyes even as a corpse.
