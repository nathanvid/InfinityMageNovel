Talent and such excuses—they were nothing but pretenses from the very beginning.

Their minds had been filled with magic from the start, leaving no room for success or honor to squeeze in.

They wanted to win. They didn't want to lose in competition. And in the end, they wanted to become the greatest mage.

Dante's eyes lit up as he watched the Inferno. It was a powerful magic he hadn't seen during the graduation exam.

'Using self-image memory to lower entropy. With Insight, it would approach zero percent. That could work.'

"Dante, Dante."

Liria, kneeling on the ground, called out to Dante behind her with a trembling voice.

"What's wrong? Is there a problem?"

"Really... is it okay to do this? Can we succeed?"

"Why are you asking me that?"

Liria turned her head to look up at Dante. Seeing her tearful face, it seemed her mental conflict was considerable.

"You always make certain choices! So tell me! If you say it, I think I'll feel at ease."

Dante understood her feelings. In battle, a mage's composure was as important as a swordsman's conviction. Fear comes not from crisis but from anxiety. Only when they could analyze the situation objectively could comrades find the courage to fight.

"I'm not optimistic. But I'm not pessimistic either."

It was literally two sides of a coin. And this was the minimum probability that would allow a mage to attempt something.

"The probability of Shirone pushing through is 50 percent. The probability of my defensive magic circle working is also 50 percent. The probability of Amy's magic working on the enemy is also 50 percent. If you add up all three cases, you'll understand what situation we're in."

Liria, who had been muttering Dante's words, suddenly widened her eyes and raised her head as if she had realized something.

"Then, then it's 150 percent?"

Dante gave a bitter smile.

"...Don't become a mage."

Remaining distance to the sealing formation installation point: 220 meters.

Shirone fired Photon Cannons in a state of selfless absorption. The flashes shooting over the back of his hands were blinding. The magic amplification orbs embedded in both hands were glowing red-hot.

"Kraaaaaah!"

The Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's waist bent as it was pushed toward the ground.

Remaining distance: 200 meters.

Jokre's legs trembled as he watched the massive Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara that seemed ready to crash at any moment.

'Is that really Shirone...?'

The person who had overwhelmed Dante, the kingdom's greatest defensive power, with firepower.

He had once thought they were still just student level. He couldn't bear the self-deprecation otherwise.

But the Photon Cannon he witnessed directly had power that even decent professionals couldn't wield.

They might not be superior to professionals in every aspect, but they had already reached professional level in at least one thing.

That was exactly what students from the five prestigious schools were.

Remaining distance: 170 meters.

"It's in range! I'll create a second barrier!"

Dante trapped the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara in a hexahedral mansion. Since information was concentrated only on the inner surfaces of the magic circle, attacks from outside weren't affected. On the other hand, the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara, now trapped within narrow walls, struggled violently.

"Grrrrrr!"

Dante's face contorted. He was dragging the mansion containing the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara down to the ground, but the resistance was fiercer than expected. Especially the fireballs spreading in all directions had enough power to destroy the defensive magic circle constructed with maximum durability within 30 seconds.

Remaining distance: 120 meters.

Dante shouted with blood vessels bulging on his face.

"Amy! Now!"

"Got it!"

As Amy leaped up from her position and swung both hands, the massive Inferno left its owner's hands and moved away. The fireball slowly crossing the sky struck the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara precisely according to the coordinates of self-image memory.

"Kraaaaaah!"

As the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's body caught fire, Dante felt the pressure ease slightly. Fire-based magic had the advantage over Photon Cannon in that it could deliver continuous impact.

Remaining distance: 40 meters.

Liria shook her head and shouted.

"It's still not enough! We can't trap it in the sealing formation like this!"

The blazing Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara clawed frantically at the magic circle inside the mansion while screaming. Finally, the magic circle that had reached the limit of its durability shattered like glass.

Liria's face was steeped in despair.

"It's over. The demigod will escape into the world."

"No, it's not over."

Liria's gaze turned skyward. Shirone, gathering brilliant light in both hands, was looking down at the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara from above. As the light in his hands grew larger, it was as if another sun had risen in the sky.

"Hyaaaaaah!"

Shirone fired the Photon Cannon with all his might. A massive flash with a diameter of one meter crashed into the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's side.

Remaining distance: 30 meters.

"Kraaaaaah!"

The Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara flailed its arms in desperation. But even its own laws couldn't withstand the mass that kept crashing down.

Remaining distance: 20 meters.

"Now! Begin!"

Liria brought her hands together and prayed.

May evil perish. May a world come where everyone can live happily. If only a paradise of goodness without hunger, murder, or adultery could be achieved, she wouldn't mind if her body were torn into thousands of pieces, or if she fell to hell to suffer eternally after earning the hatred of demons. She would become fertilizer for the world. If everyone could embrace the will of goodness, she would gladly enter the filthiest places and roll in the dirt.

She shed waterfall-like tears. A will that transcended human limits drew upon the energy of the totems embedded in the ancient castle ruins. As the prohibition magic circle disappeared, a sealing formation with a diameter of 10 meters revealed its form.

"I command in Liria's name! Evil, slumber here!"

Liria's pupils blazed golden. The flowing tears evaporated instantly, and a pillar of light made from law pierced through the sky.

"Kraaaaaah!"

As the Photon Cannon's flash pushed forward, the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara let out a death cry while flailing dozens of hands.

Remaining distance: 10 meters.

"Uaaaaaaah!"

Shirone felt the Photon Cannon's output decreasing. But when he raised the power again through Mental Transcendence, the flash amplified and completely covered the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara.

Remaining distance: 0 meters.

As the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara entered the domain of the sealing formation, Liria concentrated all her will in one place.

"Kyaaaaaaah!"

The strongest prohibition magic of the Archanis Divine Order.

Jade King Sealing Formation.

Two arms made of light twisted up like pretzels, then grabbed the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara and pulled it down to the ground.

"Kraah! Kraah! Kraaaaaah!"

The Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara resisted desperately. There was no reason for evil law to exist in a space filled with the will of goodness. Yet the fact that it persisted was clear proof that it was a demigod.

'But now it's over! Just a little, just a little more...'

Just when Liria thought it was finished, she heard footsteps. Vivian passed by her and began running toward the Jade King Sealing Formation.

"Ice Queen!"

Dante's face contorted.

"That fool!"

Liria shouted with shocked eyes.

"Don't approach! You'll be dragged in!"

The sealing formation was different from prohibition magic circles.

Because the will of goodness was concentrated in a narrow area, any human even slightly inclined toward evil would inevitably fall into the abyss.

Vivian clearly heard Liria's voice. But she never stopped running.

"This is the end. This is the finale of my play."

It had been a life where no one paid attention to her. But the Ice Queen had given her hope that she could become the protagonist. Even if the reality was a monster, even if her kindness and consideration came from ignorance, for Vivian, that was her only spotlight.

Vivian's tears streamed down her cheeks.

What would happen if she entered the sealing formation? Perhaps only the silence after the play ended would continue forever.

But she wasn't afraid. She would meet the Ice Queen. She would hold hands with her and bow to the audience. She would shout to the world, thanking them for watching a wonderful performance.

"Hyaaaaaaah!"

The moment tears filled her eyes so she couldn't see anything, Vivian kicked off the ground and threw her body toward the Jade King Sealing Formation.

"Vivian! Come back!"

Jokre sobbed and shouted.

She was a sensitive child. Perhaps her heart had collapsed in the face of a situation she couldn't take responsibility for.

But it shouldn't end this way.

It was all his fault.

If only he hadn't drunkenly entered the Ice Queen's true nature, or rather, if only he hadn't paid attention to Amy, she wouldn't have made such an extreme choice.

"Viviaaaaan!"

Jokre's cry couldn't catch Vivian. What caught her was Amy. Amy threw her body to embrace Vivian and fell, narrowly avoiding the sealing formation. At the same time, the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara crashed into the Jade King Sealing Formation as if buried. The sound of hundreds of claws scraping the ground was ominous.

"Kraaaaaah!"

Those watching were horrified by the terrifying force that gouged the earth. But even that fearsome power couldn't overcome the principle of the Jade King Sealing Formation.

It was the mysterious and profound power of law.

The Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara sank into the abyss of law, leaving only thousands of claw marks.

Then Vivian, who had been watching with tears, turned her head to Amy and shouted.

"Let go! Let me go! I'm going in too!"

"Are you crazy! You'll die if you go in there!"

"Since when have you cared about me? Do you know my heart? Do you, who've lived like a protagonist your whole life, understand my miserable feelings?"

"So you'll die? Because you're miserable?"

"No, I'll torment you to the end! I'll absolutely prevent you from succeeding! Just this once, I'll be the protagonist!"

"Don't talk nonsense, you idiot! Where is there a protagonist who gives up on life so easily!"

Amy's voice pierced Vivian's eardrums.

"Fighting is hard for everyone! But that's why you fight to the end to become the protagonist! If you give up, if you give up...!"

Amy, who became choked up while speaking, lowered her head. She too was someone who wanted to become the protagonist more than anyone.

"From that moment, you become nothing."

The feeling of being kicked out of the world's spotlight.

When everyone was looking only at those who passed, Amy had been crying alone in her room.

No one looked at her.

But now she seemed to understand.

She still had to fight.

Even if what awaited was a bad ending, those who don't fight to the end wouldn't be given the qualification to be the lead.

Not understanding why Amy had suddenly become excited, Vivian made a blank expression and opened her mouth to say something.

"I am..."

Then the ground began to vibrate. Vivian turned her head, and then everyone looked at the Jade King Sealing Formation.

As soon as Shirone landed on the ground, he shouted.

"It's not over yet!"

Dozens of hands rose from the Jade King Sealing Formation. As those that had risen vertically simultaneously bent and pushed against the floor, the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara's face emerged again.

"I am! The ruler of the world!"

The faces of Shirone's group turned pale. While it couldn't completely overcome the power of the Jade King Sealing Formation yet, there was no telling what would happen with time.

"Caught a law user? You were lucky."

Shirone turned his head with surprised eyes.

A woman with curly blonde hair, dark skin, and wearing a body-hugging suit was standing there.

It was Magic Association Secretary General Ahoya Gangnan.

"Who are you?"

Gangnan took off her high heels while walking toward the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara. And passing by Shirone's group, she said.

"Stand back. You might get hurt."

Liria shouted.

"Wait! You can't go in carelessly! If you can't handle the law, you'll be dragged in by the sealing formation's power!"

Gangnan showed no sign of hesitation and pushed her body into the Jade King Sealing Formation. She didn't know whether she was a human inclined toward good or evil. But the conviction of living as a Ramuai since the moment of birth wasn't weak enough to be shaken by law.

"Kraaaaaah! Kraaaaaaaaaah!"

The Thousand-Armed Avalokiteshvara was repeatedly rising and falling while clawing at the ground like a person drowning in the sea.
