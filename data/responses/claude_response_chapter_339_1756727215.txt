The Ice Queen made a wide circular movement around the perimeter, but she couldn't widen her angle faster than Shirone, who was rotating at the center. The moment her first step landed, shockwaves came in succession. As the Photon Cannons that had been following in a chain poured down all at once, a thin scream burst from deep within the Ice Queen's lungs.

"Kiyaaaaaaah!"

But she was not destroyed. Shirone's wrist was on the verge of breaking from continuously firing the barrage.

'Argh! Why won't she fall?'

Cold air began spreading like steam from the Ice Queen's body as she was pummeled by the Photon Cannons. The expansion accelerated over time, eventually forming a massive cloud that obscured the Queen's body.

—Remaining oxygen consumption time: 1 minute 2 seconds. 48 seconds. 35 seconds.

The oxygen reserves in Armang were rapidly depleting. When it reached zero, he would have to breathe the extremely cold air. As he desperately controlled his breathing, air began accumulating again when the remaining consumption time reached 4 seconds.

'What happened? Did I win?'

He had fired Photon Cannons at a rate of one hundred and twenty shots per minute. Any normal living creature should have been reduced to mashed potatoes.

The mist that had been gathered like clouds dispersed, finally revealing the Ice Queen.

'Th-that's...?'

Shirone's mouth fell open in bewilderment. His pupils shook violently as horror filled his expression.

* * *

Amy's Insight flashed as she saved the coordinates. Dante and Liria ran behind her. They had already run over a kilometer, but due to the nature of the circular maze, they seemed unable to get within even 100 meters of the center.

As they entered the shopping district, they saw buildings cut in half by the rising fortress walls. Amy's group entered a two-story house with its floor structure completely exposed and hid themselves.

Dante peered out the window. Setting aside Jokre's group, monsters were roaming around in every area.

"We can't keep running forever. The monsters won't get tired. Eventually, we'll have to defeat them and get out."

Liria shook her head.

"They are victims too. They cannot become targets for killing."

"What if we die in the process? The Ice Queen will grow stronger as time passes. We need to help Shirone quickly. But forget about destroying the maze—we're stuck at the monster stage."

"It's not a matter of efficiency or results. Violence without the will of good is no different from evil methodology. I'm not forcing you, but if you plan to help me, even if we die, we must not harm innocent people."

Dante smiled bitterly. It wasn't pretense or falsehood. Strengthening one's will to control logic was only possible when one possessed beliefs without a trace of deception.

"Is that the mindset of a mage? Well, we have such a naive teacher at our school too. Ethella."

Liria spoke firmly as if the idea was preposterous.

"It's not naivety, it's conviction. The world is maintained because there are those who try to uphold the will of good equal to the number of evils that prevail. If we follow evil methods just because the situation is urgent, we'll eventually come under evil's dominion! I don't expect you, being a magician, to understand the ancient conflict between good and evil, but...!"

Dante waved his hand to interrupt.

"Fine. Enough with the lecture. I'm a magician, as you said. So what do you plan to do now?"

Liria, having calmed her excitement, explained.

"I'll reduce the area of effect of the wide-area barrier set up at the castle ruins to increase its power. It's a technique called Concentrated Barrier. If the coordinates are accurately set, even a demigod's law cannot escape."

Dante's expression turned serious.

"But that means if we fail..."

"Right, even the barrier, our last bastion, will be destroyed. The Ice Queen who escapes into the world will become even stronger. Therefore, we only have one chance. If we can't create that opportunity, I won't attempt the Concentrated Barrier even if it means death."

Dante felt the same way. If the Ice Queen escaped the barrier, the scale of damage would grow uncontrollably. It would be more efficient to keep her trapped here even if everyone perished.

"Good. So what do we need to help with?"

"The coordinates for the Concentrated Barrier can't be set arbitrarily. It must be installed at the point where the barrier's power concentrates."

"Where is that?"

"It's the vertex when you draw an inverted pyramid from the barrier. Take me there."

"One mountain after another."

Finding the installation point for the Concentrated Barrier in a maze crawling with monsters was nearly impossible. At minimum, the maze needed to disappear for the operation to have a chance.

"Fine. Let's go with that plan. Liria and I will handle the monsters, so Amy, you eliminate the maze. You're the only one with Insight who can reach the center of the Spirit's Radius."

Liria said worriedly.

"Will she be okay alone? Their abilities aren't magic. The other two must have gained abilities comparable to the maze."

"That's exactly why Amy needs to step up. They'll probably target Amy first. In that case, it's better to split up and move separately. Amy, you can do it, right?"

Amy couldn't answer. Jokre's group had grown stronger. No, even before getting stronger, they were skilled enough to pass the graduating class examination.

'And I... was eliminated.'

Dante spoke.

"You can do it. Believe in yourself."

"I can't believe it. I really have no confidence."

Amy was sincere.

"If you can't believe in yourself, at least believe in your family."

As Amy raised her head, Dante placed his hand on her shoulder.

"There's no way you can't do what your entire family can do. Fight using everything you have."

Countless family members were proving their talent. That's why she could believe in herself in any situation.

As a resolute determination settled in Amy's eyes, Dante left the building with a satisfied expression.

"Let's go, Liria. While they focus on Amy, we need to get as close to the coordinates as possible."

Liria followed Dante and asked.

"Will it be okay? She doesn't seem very confident."

"She has her reasons. But it'll be fine. She seems a bit lost right now, but..."

Dante smiled as he spoke.

"She's not stupid enough to not know who's superior."

* * *

"Ho ho ho! The way you run is exquisite! Truly befitting a student from a prestigious school!"

"Tch! Shut up!"

Wherever Amy ran, Vivian popped out from walls to hurl mocking words. She was doing her best to find a way, but everywhere she went was within Vivian's palm.

The wall in Amy's running direction suddenly opened, and Rudbans appeared chewing gum.

"Divine Wrath."

As he drove an invisible shock sphere into the ground, a shockwave with electrical and elastic forces erupted, lifting Amy's body into the air.

"I can see your panties."

As Amy landed after performing a somersault in the air, Jokre approached rapidly from the side.

"Speed Gear!"

The movement of Speed Gear, which adjusted inertia from level 1 to 10, completely defied physical laws. With existing common sense destroyed, even space and time felt distorted.

Amy hastily deployed an Air Shield. Jokre's Fireball exploded, pushing her body far away.

'I can't find Vivian like this. I need to get up onto the fortress wall somehow.'

In the air, she might be able to activate Air Tunnel to directly strike Vivian's main body. But getting such an opportunity against Jokre's group wouldn't be easy.

'The ground is blocked by walls. Is sniper mode impossible after all? Maybe if I injure one of them to tie them down...'

Amy shook her head. She was overthinking again. Dante's advice flashed through her mind.

—You have no style.

'Style. My style.'

There was no method to handle every situation. Amy focused her thoughts solely on sniper mode. At the same time, her eyes flashed open. A crucial idea struck her mind like lightning.

'Maybe... no, I can do it. I can do this.'

After examining the fortress wall structure, Amy set arbitrary points A and B to draw an imaginary chord. Then, based on the wall's curvature, she measured the radian value and combined the Pythagorean theorem with trigonometric functions to derive the central coordinates where Vivian's main body was located.

'I have the coordinates. But to strike...'

Sniper mode alone was impossible. In a situation where walls blocked all directions, flames couldn't extend outward.

But Amy didn't give up. Like Shirone and Dante, she deepened her strategy further.

'It's possible. As long as it's heavier than air...'

Amy's Insight flashed rapidly like electricity.

'I need more, more powerful force.'

Power. Power. Power. Power. Power.

Her self-image memory began repeating hundreds of backups per second, starting to eliminate Amy's distracting thoughts.

Extreme self-censorship.

Her mind penetrated toward a single purpose in a state where not even 1% impurity was mixed in.

Concentrating on concentration.

As if an explosion occurred in her head, her mental power amplified by the square of multiplication.

Ildo—The Way of One.

It was a temporary state of samadhi that occurred when focusing on a single thought without any trace of distraction.

'Inferno.'

From beneath Amy's legs, two streams of fire twisted together like a braid and rose above her head.

"Wh-what is that?"

Upon discovering the size of the flames Amy created, Jokre's group stopped their charge and showed surprised expressions. The gas density was so thick that flames were dripping down like paint.

"That's..."

Jokre, who specialized in flame magic, realized what Amy was attempting.

A thousand-degree fire that even professional mages found difficult to achieve.

Judging by the flame's color, heat of at least 1,300 degrees was burning above her head.

"You, you... that..."

Jokre's group didn't dare approach. If the Inferno exploded, everything within its radius would melt.

Amy turned toward the fortress wall and spoke.

"Right. You couldn't even imitate it."

Jokre frowned in confusion. He couldn't understand why she was aiming at the wrong place after casting magic to break the situation. But Vivian realized immediately. Despite her petrified face, an expression of horror was clearly visible.

"No! Jokre, stop her!"

Amy raised both hands to support the massive flame.

"Stop her! Stop her! She's planning to attack the main body!"

Jokre didn't understand Vivian's words. How could she attack the main body when blocked by a 30-meter-high barrier?

Amy smiled with satisfaction and said.

"This is my style."

Bending her upper body back like a bow, she snapped her waist forward while swinging both hands downward. The thousand-degree flame Inferno flew over the 30-meter-high barrier toward the sky beyond.

Rudbans muttered with a blank expression.

"Howitzer..."

The fireball boasting tremendous gas density crossed the sky in a parabolic arc.

While curved fire had the advantage of ignoring cover, it also had the disadvantage of reduced accuracy, but Amy could strike target points with machine-like precision through her self-image memory.

"Kyaaaak!"

Vivian's clone screamed and disappeared. If Inferno fell on the center of the maze, she would instantly melt while unable to move in her petrified state.

Rumble rumble rumble rumble!

The fortress walls spanning a 1-kilometer radius simultaneously collapsed into the ground, and Vivian, released from her petrified state, continued her clone's scream while hastily evacuating.

When the Inferno that reached the ground exploded, the earth's surface melted like molten metal. Turbid black impurities floated on the lava glowing red like a fluorescent light before quickly cooling in the cold air.

The terrain before and after Inferno's impact was completely different. The ground was grotesquely distorted like a demon's face.

Vivian, who barely escaped death, reached Jokre. Though the maze had disappeared, Amy was nowhere to be seen. As Jokre looked around with an annoyed expression, he muttered.

"Damn! Where did she hide?"

A dull thud came from where Rudbans was. As a burning stone struck the back of his head, he collapsed without even managing to groan.
