**[347] Divine Transcendence (4)**

For now, he was holding his ground through physical ability alone, but eventually, as his competitors' levels rose, the gap would inevitably widen.

That was why the school, despite knowing Rian's circumstances, couldn't readily make exceptions to the rules.

"We'll start the evaluation with Group 1. Groups 2 and 3, come out and warm up. The rest can rest."

The cadets in Group 1 glared fiercely as they headed to the training ground. As Kuan sat down with his evaluation sheet and gave the starting signal, they let out monster-like battle cries and engaged in violent close combat.

As Kuan focused on the match, the cadets relaxed. As always, Tess came to sit beside Rian. She enjoyed talking with Rian before evaluations. It felt like being alone with a lover on a battlefield, perhaps?

But Tess's small pleasure was ruined when Bavier approached.

Walking over with his developed jaw thrust forward, he looked down at Rian and said:

"Hey, Rian. How about it? Think you can avoid last place this time?"

"Mind your own business. It's none of your concern."

"Haha! Of course not. Last place is none of my business. But I suddenly had an interesting thought. Maybe it has something to do with you."

"What are you talking about?"

When Rian turned around, Bavier pointed at himself with his thumb.

"How about fighting me? Wrestling. Who knows? If you beat me, the strongest, maybe the school will recognize you too. If you want to escape last place, you have to try everything, right?"

Rian turned his gaze away with disinterest.

"I don't need anyone's recognition. If I have to fight, I'll fight anyone, but I don't want to show off my strength pointlessly."

Bavier smiled faintly. It was the typical words of the weak—wanting to avoid fights while maintaining their pride.

But this time, that pride would be his downfall.

"Hmm. You can take responsibility for those words, right?"

Saying this, Bavier surveyed the training ground. He didn't miss the gap as Group 2's match was ending and raised his hand.

"Instructor! I have a suggestion."

"What is it?"

"I want to compete with Rian. Please allow it. We've already agreed between ourselves."

For a cadet to change the evaluation format was something that couldn't be done without extraordinary courage.

But this time, even Kuan fell into deep thought. If it involved Rian, it was interesting to him too.

He was curious to see how far Mental Transcendence could hold out against Bavier, who had the best physical abilities among their peers.

"I'll hear the opinions of the same group before deciding."

Even if Rian and Bavier had agreed, the other group members might think differently.

But Bavier was confident.

Since no one could beat him in wrestling anyway, they wouldn't refuse the proposal if it meant getting high scores.

As expected, Bavier's opponent readily agreed.

Even if victory or defeat didn't affect grades, it was difficult to showcase one's strengths against an opponent with an overwhelming skill difference.

Rian's opponent had no reason to refuse either. If it was Rian, who wasn't a Schema user, at best it would be break-even, and at worst, serious loss.

As each party's interests aligned and the matter was settled, Kuan drew two lines through the names on his evaluation sheet and changed the group members.

"Good. Rian and Bavier will enter Group 17."

As Bavier sat beside Rian with a satisfied smile, Tess felt inexplicably anxious.

There weren't many among their peers who could subdue Rian in practical swordsmanship, but Bavier in wrestling was truly dangerous.

She couldn't understand what he was thinking by proposing such a match, but she could only hope it would end as just part of the evaluation.

Bavier looked at Rian's hardened face and said:

"How about it? We're really going to fight now. You're not regretting it, are you? If you're scared, say so now. I'll go easy on you."

Rian didn't answer. If he had nothing to say, he wasn't the type to make up words.

The evaluation proceeded smoothly after that.

When Group 8 entered the arena, Tess from Group 10 prepared to go out. Wrestling was intense exercise, so without proper stretching beforehand, there was a high risk of injury.

"Rian, I'll be back."

"Yeah. Do your best."

Bavier added a comment:

"It's nothing special as an opponent. Show them upper-tier skills."

Tess ignored Bavier's words and headed to the training ground. Even so, Bavier wasn't offended. There wasn't much time left for her to give him cold looks. Once his match with Rian began, her gaze would burn hot.

Tess's turn came. Her opponent was someone called Godim, a straightforward swordsman. Maintaining his crew cut from his training days, he blushed when he faced Tess.

At a school that taught killing techniques, distinguishing between men and women was foolish. But he thought there was no need to wrestle together, which involved intense physical contact.

Nevertheless, once the match began, Godim's eyes sharpened like a warrior facing a beast.

Tess charged first and collided with Godim. Godim lowered his center of gravity and extended both arms to pull at her thighs. Her legs lifted momentarily, but Tess exquisitely spun once to neutralize the technique.

Seeing this, Bavier smiled with satisfaction.

"Impressive as always, Tess. Really a wonderful woman. Don't you think?"

Rian also acknowledged Tess's talent and skills. But Bavier's words were unpleasant. He knew the man's gaze was directed not at Tess's technique, but at her body.

"Why do you want to fight me?"

"You should know the reason."

Bavier sneered. Seeing that taciturn mouth open, he seemed to be getting anxious about losing Tess.

"If that's really the reason, don't involve Tess again. Instead, if you want to fight, come find me anytime. I won't run away or avoid it."

"Haha! How confident. But will you have a next time?"

Bavier decided to get to the point. Now that Tess was absent was the perfect opportunity to reveal his true feelings.

"Ozent Rian. I've heard the rumors. They call your training demonic practice. You've staked your life on victory, something like that? Anyway, fine. In that case, how about the loser of this match withdraws from Tess?"

Rian snorted dismissively.

"You think Tess will choose you just because you beat me?"

"That doesn't matter. You leaving and Tess choosing me are separate things. I'm asking about your resolve."

Rian postponed his answer and looked at Tess. Her wrestling was different from Godim's. She was disrupting her opponent's breathing with flexibility and balance rather than strength.

Tess's talent was definitely real. On the other hand, he had no talent and no future. In this situation, contemplating what kind of existence she was to him was just luxury.

"I won't bet on someone's heart."

"Hmph. Running away because it's unfavorable?"

"But I'll tell you this."

Rian's eyes flashed as he glared at Bavier.

"Even if you kill me in this match, I absolutely won't hold a grudge."

Rian's fighting spirit was sincere. But Bavier was also naturally tough and had a military temperament, so hostility came before fear.

"Haha! Big words? You think I can't do it?"

Just then, a thud came from the training ground. Rian and Bavier turned simultaneously. Tess was in a position where she had grabbed Godim's arm and slammed him to the ground.

Godim looked up at the sky with an expression that showed he didn't understand what had happened, then sat up with a reddened face.

"I lost. It was a good match."

"Phew. You did well too. Actually, that last move was a gamble."

An overturning throw using the opponent's pushing force against them. If she had misjudged, she would have had no choice but to give up her back, but there was no way Tess, with her sensory-type Schema, could fail to catch the opponent's center shift. Godim also knew her words were consideration for the loser and gracefully accepted defeat.

Tess returned to Rian and made a V-sign with both hands.

"Hehe. I'm done. Now it's vacation time."

But the atmosphere was quite different from before. Rian's expression was even colder, and Bavier's eyes also burned with killing intent. Something had definitely happened while she was away.

"Rian. Why is your expression like that? Bavier, what happened?"

Bavier shrugged his shoulders and played innocent.

"Why are you asking me that? I didn't do anything."

Tess looked at Bavier with suspicious eyes, then had no choice but to sit down. She knew it was a lie, but Rian wouldn't answer even if she asked.

When Group 15's match began, Rian from Group 17 entered the training ground to warm up. Then Bavier, pretending to follow, looked back at Tess and said:

"Tess. You'll know soon. How worthless Rian is. And how wonderful a man I am too."

"What nonsense? No matter what you do, the day you look good in my eyes will never come."

"That's harsh. We're friends though. You know what? I made a bet with Rian earlier."

"A bet? What bet?"

"The loser of this match agreed to give you up. I thought you should know in advance."

Tess snorted and shook her head.

"Bavier, Rian would never bet another person. That's the difference between you and Rian."

Bavier was displeased with Tess's blind trust but didn't show it. Moreover, this was precisely the driving force that had allowed him to spread countless scandals in social circles.

"Is that so? Just watch and see."

Anyway, since the match was arranged, it didn't matter. If Tess saw Rian being miserably beaten in front of the cadets, she couldn't help but feel ashamed. In that regard, wrestling was perfect. He could take time to slowly torment his opponent.

When Group 17's turn came, Rian and Bavier faced each other in the arena. When they actually compared their bare bodies, the difference in build was almost 1.5 times. Even though Rian was by no means small for his age, Bavier's bulk-up was truly terrifying, making it look like a match between an adult and a child.

The cadets fixed their gazes on the two. Like people expecting the cruel predation that could only be seen in the wild.

Rian would be devoured. The disadvantage of not being able to use Schema was fatal in every aspect.

The reason Rian received recognition was because he kept up with the curriculum through physical ability alone, but in terms of skill, he was never the best.

Bavier cracked his thick neck and said:

"Shall we begin then? You're ready, right?"

"Anytime. Since it's come to this, let's have a good match."

As Rian and Bavier took wrestling stances, Kuan also put away his writing and focused on their match.

The moment the starting signal dropped, the two collided.

From the moment their bodies touched, they were free to do anything. But Bavier pushed forward head-first, delivering impact from the very start.

There was a crack. It was a sound that made one fear that skulls might have shattered.

Kuan didn't consider it a foul. Collisions for the sake of close contact were common.

Rian hadn't been unprepared either, but the moment their heads collided, sparks exploded before his eyes and his upper body tilted back.

In this type of collision, weight was everything in the end. This was why Bavier had desperately bulked up.

As Rian staggered, Bavier immediately followed up and grabbed Rian's neck. Rian also hastily regained his composure and took the same position. It was like two bulls standing with their horns locked together. In the breathless state, both their faces reddened. Gradually, Rian's legs began to slide along the ground as he was pushed back. Again, it was weight that decided it.

"Hrrrrrrr..."

Breath leaked between Bavier's teeth. He had heard rumors, but facing him directly was shocking. Rian couldn't use Schema. He should have normally been knocked out in the first collision.
