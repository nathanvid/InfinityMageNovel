title: Wave of Law (2)

The Ice Queen slowly raised her hand and spoke.

"Weak humans, kneel before me."

As the Ice Queen's voice turned serious, the tourists clapped and cheered with delight.

"Nice voice! That sounds convincing!"

"Hey, Your Majesty! Look this way too. Come on, this is a chance to shake hands with the Ice Queen... Gack!"

The man suddenly grabbed his throat and fell to his knees.

The same situation occurred to people everywhere simultaneously.

Their blood-flushed faces were red as if they would burst at any moment. They desperately gasped for air, but their breathing grew increasingly labored.

Only Shirone's group remained standing normally.

Shirone observed the changes in the people. Before he knew it, necklaces with conical thorn collars had appeared around their necks.

Liria frowned and muttered.

"That's a dharma wheel...?"

A dharma wheel was an exorcism tool of the Exorcist Society that contained the principles of law in its form, with its effectiveness maximized the closer it approached a perfect circle.

Dharma wheels available to civilians were mere imitations that at best provided mental and physical stability.

However, the official dharma wheels possessed by exorcists were impossible to manufacture unless created by weaponsmiths who had reached the realm of nirvana.

From Liria's perspective, the dharma wheels around people's necks were genuine.

While the perfection of a circle couldn't be distinguished by the naked eye, exorcists who had undergone long training could sense the nature of a circle through their inner sight.

"Binding dharma wheels. These aren't from this world. You all be careful too. If you get caught in the Wave of Law, you'll end up like them."

As all the people affected by the Wave of Law lost strength in their legs and knelt down, the dharma wheels loosened and air finally entered their airways.

Rough breathing sounds could be heard from everywhere.

"Gack! Gack! What is this? Who put these necklaces on us?"

"Hey! Someone please take this thing off!"

Watching the people screaming in terror, Jokre felt a thrill run down his spine.

The form of the dharma wheels was a manifestation of the Ice Queen's unique memories, but the method of strangling people's necks was a strategy he had suggested.

The Ice Queen could change the rules of the world.

He had wondered if such a thing was really possible, but seeing everyone kneeling made him realize it with certainty.

The legend of the Ice Queen who dominated the era 800 years ago was an undeniable fact.

'It worked! It really worked! I never thought such a day would come for me.'

At this rate, conquering the world wasn't just a dream.

Moreover, perhaps because she had been dormant for 800 years, she couldn't remember anything from the past.

The sorceress who had made the world tremble in fear had become a child who could be coaxed with a single piece of candy.

'The Ice Queen will be mine.'

After settling things here, he planned to gently coax the Ice Queen into becoming his woman.

It was strange to date someone over eight hundred years old, but if he played his cards right, she seemed likely to fall for him, and above all, she was beautiful.

Her appearance was in no way inferior to Amy, who had coldly rejected him five years ago.

While he was lost in such fantasies, the Ice Queen turned to look at Jokre and asked.

"Is this how I should do it?"

Jokre smiled with satisfaction at the Ice Queen's attitude of depending on him and asking about even the smallest details.

However, since there was still no need to displease her, he bowed his head as if addressing a real queen and answered.

"Yes. Everyone will come to obey Your Majesty."

Liria realized that most elements forming the Ice Queen's personality were influenced by Jokre's input.

'So it's as the prophecy foretold...'

Like most descent myths, this time too the Ice Queen would meet one human and plunge the world into an abyss of evil.

Shirone watched with a disgusted expression as hundreds of people knelt in the desolate scene.

"What exactly is this? It doesn't seem like magic."

It was a natural question from someone who didn't understand the law.

This wasn't equivalent exchange.

There was no way to put strangling dharma wheels on hundreds of people simply because they didn't follow orders.

Even Ikael's irregular formula from Heaven's Department of Fairies wasn't this bizarre.

Dante, who had no time for explanations, spoke briefly.

"It's an ability called the law. Be careful. That woman has the ability to change the rules of the world."

"Changing rules?"

The first thing Shirone thought of was the Akashic Records.

However, no being except an Infinity Mage could twist rules on such a massive scale.

Then there was one possibility.

If it had been the Akashic Records from the beginning.

"Some kind of... conceptual entity?"

Liria turned her head with wide eyes.

Identifying the essence of a mental entity that had dedicated itself to a human body was impossible unless one was involved in spiritual pursuits.

'This child knows about the law...'

Most people live without knowing that the world operates according to overall rules.

It was surprising that Shirone knew the mechanism of the law, which was passed down only to a select few even within the divine orders.

"That's right. It was a mental entity whose rank couldn't be measured from the beginning. It's a phenomenon called a demigod. It's impossible for you who don't know the law to defend against it. Don't stray from me."

Amy raised her fist and shouted at Jokre.

"You! What exactly are you plotting?"

"Hahaha! Plotting? Does this still look like a joke to you? We're going to conquer the world."

"Stop talking nonsense! Do you really want to get hit?"

Jokre snorted and announced to the people.

"Everyone worship the Queen. If you don't follow orders, the Queen's law will kill you."

As the dharma wheels tightened around their necks, the pale-faced people pressed their hands to the ground and gasped.

Then they cried out in strangled voices.

"L-Long live the Queen!"

"We will follow Your Majesty!"

When the faces of those who worshipped the queen returned to a peaceful state, Shirone finally realized the seriousness of the situation.

The law was also being applied to Jokre's instructions. Unlike magic that logically designates targets, the law was a process of readjusting the overall balance.

As sounds of praising the Ice Queen pierced the sky, Jokre tasted a pleasure he had never felt once in his life.

It was as if they were all worshipping him.

"How's that? This is my power. If you come under me even now, I'll spare you from such a fate."

Jokre expected Shirone's group to tremble in fear. But contrary to his expectations, none of them moved and they were all watching the situation.

Dante, with his hands in his pockets, walked out casually.

"Hey, you. Is there something wrong with your head? Do you know what you're doing right now?"

"Ha! You think I'm crazy? Not a chance! Don't you see what state people are in? You'll all end up like that eventually too."

"You almost killed hundreds of people just now."

The color drained from Jokre's face.

"Conquer the world? Do you even know what that means when you say it? Can you really take responsibility for those words?"

"Grrrk...!"

Jokre couldn't answer.

Becoming the ruler of the world was an ambition that any man would have harbored at least once. But when it came to reality, he was just one human who didn't want to go to prison, and even less wanted to die.

The Ice Queen could change the rules. Therefore, if he put leashes on them, they would obey orders rather than die.

That was the entirety of Jokre's calculated thinking.

But what if they refused?

They would all become corpses with their necks completely broken.

Of course, no one in the world wanted to die, but once he imagined it, unbearable fear washed over him.

'Can I really conquer the world?'

Perhaps he had been temporarily insane, as Dante said.

While he was having such thoughts, Vivian's voice was heard.

"Hmph! So what if that's the case? If they follow our words, no one will die! Then the first victims will be you!"

Jokre looked at Vivian with a blank expression. Overnight, her eyes had completely changed.

"How long did you think you'd be the protagonists of this world? We're the ones controlling this situation now!"

'Vivian...'

Looking at Vivian, Jokre realized.

She was prepared to lose everything to seize this one opportunity that had come into her life.

Right, there was no place left to retreat. Having come this far, they had to see it through to the end, whatever happened.

Great enterprises required courage, after all.

Regaining his composure, Jokre stretched out his hand and walked forward.

"Kneel, Amy. And apologize to me. If you don't, I'll kill everyone here."

Shocked by Jokre's words, people raised their heads. They could already feel the dharma wheels tightening around their necks.

"Hey! Kneel! We're really going to die at this rate!"

"Damn brats! Hurry up and do as you're told! Apologize!"

The tourists didn't care what Shirone's group had done wrong to Jokre.

If they didn't follow orders, they would all die.

Even if they had done nothing wrong, they naturally had to obey Jokre.

"Apologize! Bow down to those people! I have a wife and children! It's nothing!"

"Please spare my life! Do as you're told!"

None of Shirone's group moved.

If they gave up control here, they would inevitably be dragged along by Jokre's group's intentions from now on.

Amy glared at Jokre with cold eyes.

"Why me specifically? Why do you particularly want my apology? Because I didn't accept your feelings?"

As Amy hit the mark, Jokre's face reddened.

The flustered appearance she had shown at the skating rink was nowhere to be found. This was a battlefield, and caring about personal emotions was a luxury.

'It's working. That guy, does he really want an apology from me because of that? How foolish...'

Provoking Jokre wouldn't necessarily produce a good solution, but to create variables, they had to shake up their opponent.

As planned, Jokre couldn't hide his bewilderment. He felt angry that his petty feelings had been exposed.

"Shut up! If you don't follow my words, everyone dies! Do you really not care if all the people here die?"

Dante said.

"If people die, that's because you killed them. We haven't done anything. Become a murderer and spend your life running away."

Dante was sincere.

For a mage, distinguishing between good and evil wasn't that important an issue. If there was no solution to the situation, it was better to sacrifice people than let things spiral toward the worst possible outcome.

"Amy, you don't need to be swayed by words from such a guy. He doesn't have the guts for it anyway."

Jokre shouted threateningly.

"Hmph! Is that really so? Should I really kill them? Huh!"

The terrified people hurled abuse at Amy.

"You damn girl! Are you really going to get us all killed? Kneel! Apologize!"

"Please spare my life! We're all going to die at this rate!"

Amy bit her lip.

Her judgment wasn't different from Dante's thinking. Even if she complied with their demands, only bigger demands would await. 

However, being the one singled out, with hundreds of lives hanging on her judgment, her blood ran cold.

"Let's buy time for now. I'll do as they say."

As Amy approached, the corners of Jokre's mouth turned up.

'Of course, what could someone like her do by resisting?'

At that moment, Shirone grabbed Amy's shoulder. When Amy turned around with a surprised expression, sparks flew from Jokre's eyes.

"What are you doing? Even if everyone dies, you want to preserve your girlfriend's pride?"

Shirone didn't bother to deny it.

"That's right. There's no reason for Amy to follow your words."

Jokre's face contorted.

Was this what they called the cold rationality of mages?

No, it was arrogance.

Preserving his girlfriend's pride couldn't be more valuable than hundreds of lives.
