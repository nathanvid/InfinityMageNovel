"10 snowballs for 10 silver means 1 silver each? That's really expensive."

For Shirone, who had grown up in the mountains since childhood without experiencing festivals, this was a cultural shock.

But Amy acted like it was natural.

"Tourist products come with a premium. Plus, that Ice Queen stuffed doll is quite famous. It's strategically made by the autonomous district and can only be obtained at the winter festival. The types of dolls change every year, so there are even collections."

"Oh really, is that so?"

Shirone's eyes sparkled.

If it was a festival limited edition, it was only natural that the price would rise over time.

If he could just win the game, paying 10 silver for 10 snowballs wouldn't be such a bad deal.

"Alright, I'll give it a try. Look forward to it."

Shirone paid 10 silver.

"10 snowballs, please."

"Here we have another brave participant. May the Ice Queen's blessing be upon you."

Though having the Ice Queen's blessing probably wouldn't lead to anything good, since her character itself was a tourist product, he just went along with it.

Shirone received the box containing the snowballs.

When he entered the game area, there was someone already trying. While waiting, he lifted and felt the snow clumps in the box - they were mixed with water and felt solid and heavy.

'Hmm, this should have quite a range.'

Throwing itself wasn't the problem.

However, looking at the challenge, he could only send snowballs to the spire across through windows cut in the wall.

Because the throwing angle was limited, it would be difficult to generate power, and accuracy would also drop considerably.

"Phew, this is unexpectedly difficult."

The challenger who failed wiped his sweat and stepped back.

People who visited the winter festival every year knew how difficult it was to win the Ice Queen collection, so they weren't disappointed.

Following the host's guidance, Shirone entered the game area, set the box down beside him, and picked up a snowball.

Rolling it with his fingers to gauge the distance, he opened his body wide and threw the snowball with all his might.

The snowball that passed through the window fell downward under gravity's force and shattered against the castle wall below the watchtower.

Pleasant laughter from the tourists could be heard.

Normally, Shirone would have laughed too, but with Amy watching, his face flushed.

Unable to bring himself to look back at her, he hurriedly picked up the next snowball and analyzed his failure.

'I can't raise the angle, so I can't generate power. This is much harder than I thought.'

Indeed, since it was a game with a festival limited edition as the prize, it wouldn't have been designed for just anyone to succeed.

"Ugh...!"

Shirone gritted his teeth and threw the snowball.

Whether his determination paid off, he was barely able to match the distance. But the snowball passed by the soldier target and fell in the wrong place.

"Huff! Huff!"

Shirone, now stubborn, threw snowballs in succession.

Since he had succeeded at Thunder Strike in one try, he thought if he gradually reduced the error, he would eventually succeed.

But at the point of throwing 5, he realized.

'This is harder than Thunder Strike?'

The rules were simple, but it was by no means a carelessly made game.

It was designed to look like anyone could succeed, but by cleverly adjusting the throwing angle and distance, it was made so that only natural strongmen or professionals could succeed.

After throwing all 10 snowballs, Shirone was panting.

Despite the cold weather, his body was hot and sweat beaded on his forehead. Since he was wearing Armang, he couldn't even take off his coat.

Shirone sheepishly stuck out his tongue and returned to Amy.

"Uh, sorry. I failed."

"What's to be sorry about? It's just a game. But that really does look difficult."

Through Shirone's challenge, Amy could guess that the game's difficulty was top-tier.

According to her Insight analysis, considering strength, gravity, and even air friction, there weren't many routes that could reach the target.

"Hahaha! Failed spectacularly. Students from magic school, they say. How pathetic."

Shirone and Amy turned around simultaneously. A shaggy-haired boy was approaching with a mocking smile.

Behind him, a tall curly-haired young man and a heavily made-up girl stood in arrogant poses as if guarding the rear.

"Long time no see, Amy."

When Jokre extended his hand, Amy remained motionless for a long time, lost in thought.

Since entering magic school, she hadn't particularly kept in touch with anyone other than school friends.

Especially not with boys.

"Um, sorry but... who are you?"

Jokre's face crumpled.

How could she not remember him?

Even if she had rejected him, receiving a confession from someone should be an unforgettable memory.

At least Jokre thought so.

Actually, he had never received a confession from a girl, but if such a thing happened, he was confident he would make it a lifelong source of pride.

"Are you pretending not to know, or do you really not know? Jokre. Alpheas Magic School. Really don't know?"

"Jokre? Jokre..."

Amy, who had been muttering, opened her eyes wide and pointed at Jokre.

"Ah, ah, ah! Wow! It really has been a long time."

Though she didn't seem particularly welcoming, just being dramatically surprised was enough to make Jokre's shoulders rise with pride in front of his friends.

The person recognizing him was none other than the renowned Carmis Amy.

But since he hadn't approached to catch up with an old classmate, he lifted his chin and looked down.

"Hmph, shouldn't you greet me properly first?"

"Huh? What greeting?"

Jokre swept his arm over his friends behind him, then pointed to himself with his thumb.

"I hear you're still attending school, but we're official mages. That is, we're unofficial 10th-rank mages."

Official mages.

Amy felt her heart sink. It was a phrase that had never left her mind for a moment since entering Alpheas Magic School at age twelve.

Hoping her face wasn't hardening, Amy extended her hand to Jokre.

"I see. Congratulations. You finally graduated."

At the time, Amy had been thirteen. She barely remembered Jokre, but she clearly recalled feeling disdainful when he transferred schools as if running away.

A smile spread across Jokre's lips.

Amy's poker face was perfect, but he could see her heart without her opening it.

How frustrated must she be, watching him from her position of having failed the graduation exam, when she was recognized as a genius of the Carmis family?

'Hmph, how does it feel? When you rejected me, the feeling was much more miserable than this.'

Jokre turned his gaze to Shirone, who stood there blankly.

"I get to see a celebrity here. Arian Shirone. The kingdom's top prospect, they say?"

Shirone maintained silence for now. He could sense that the approach wasn't friendly.

"Shall I give you some advice as a senior? A prospect is ultimately just a prospect. The real competition starts after becoming an official mage. Well, for a commoner, you've succeeded well enough. Hahaha!"

Amy shouted with an angry face.

"Jokre! What are you saying? Quickly apologize to Shirone!"

"Why should I? I didn't say anything wrong. Oh, was it an open secret? But giving up would be better for your mental health. It's already been published in academic journals. There's no student who doesn't know."

"Really? Then how about I also say whatever comes to mind? Are you confident it'll be okay?"

Jokre's eyes turned fierce. He didn't know what she was going to say, but he couldn't help feeling guilty in advance.

'Amy...'

The Amy he met again after 5 years had grown into a much prettier girl than in childhood.

Her hair was permed in a style not seen in academic journals, and her clothes were chosen in a bright and cute style. Anyone could see she had dressed up with care.

'Tch! A look only Shirone gets to see, I suppose.'

Among the male students at Eins Magic School, Amy held the largest share of attention.

Considering the entire kingdom, the numbers would be much higher.

The thought that such a girl would put on makeup and carefully choose pretty clothes for only one person made him feel defeated by Shirone without even fighting.

'I'm disappointed, Amy. How could you date a commoner without losing your mind? No matter how skilled he is, that guy is just a student too.'

Seeing Shirone frowning without even being able to talk back after being insulted as a lowborn made his irritation rise even more.

'He could at least argue back, but he's not saying a word? Is he ignoring me? No, he must be scared by the mention of being an official mage. Pathetically hiding behind a woman as a man... tsk tsk.'

Jokre was mistaken.

To Shirone, who had even fought against Boson, a certified 4th-rank mage, the title of official mage wasn't much of a threat.

The reason Shirone was frowning wasn't because of Jokre, but because of Armang at his waist.

The human mind flows like water.

And Armang's Remote Control was a delicate function with a synchronization rate approaching 100 percent with the owner's mind.

If he couldn't perfectly control his emotions, Armang would move before he could even calm his heart.

That's why it was a magic sword.

Of course, it wouldn't have mattered to the previous owner, Zion. He could just kill whatever his emotions directed him to.

But Shirone had to continue his school life normally.

As a commoner with nowhere to turn, if he committed murder, he could fall into an irreversible situation.

Most importantly, since returning from Kasula, it had become difficult to control his emotions like before.

The demon Behemoth was trapped in a sealing formation, but remained connected to Shirone's mind through the keyword of anger.

If emotions were amplified to an uncontrollable state, Armang would cut the opponent's throat without giving him time to reconsider.

'I shouldn't have worn it out after all. I need to be more careful from now on.'

Seeing Shirone unable to fight back in the end, Jokre clicked his tongue and pointed to the game area while speaking to Amy.

"Academic journals aren't all believable, it seems. Unable to even give his girlfriend a single doll as a gift. Shall we show a demonstration from our side?"

Amy shrugged her shoulders.

It was a game anyone could play by paying money, so what was there to permit or not permit?

"Fine, do it if you want."

Jokre's group entered the game area.

As if conscious of Shirone's challenge, Vivian spoke loudly enough to be heard on purpose.

"Guys, if you win the Ice Queen, you have to give it to me."

"Let's try first. Well, it should be easy for Rudbans."

The host handed over the box containing snowballs. The person who paid was Jokre, but the person who received the box was Rudbans.

Jokre looked back at Shirone and Amy, who were watching with interest, and pointed at Rudbans with his thumb.

"Rudbans is our school's representative 'siege' player. You can look forward to it."

Siege was a combat sport derived from ancient warfare, where teams of five hide behind cover in an arena and hit opponents with rubber balls.

Among amateurs, it was a game even small children could enjoy, but at the semi-professional level like inter-school competitions, fastball speeds approached 160 kilometers per hour.

With tactics using three-cushion shots and various changeups developed, it was both thrilling and high-risk for injury.

Rudbans was the school's ace, and the Eins siege team was strong enough to reach the quarterfinals in last year's national tournament.

"Let's see... shall I start with reconnaissance?"

Rudbans' posture was distinctly different from ordinary people. Each movement segment had its mechanism, and they flowed together smoothly to create maximum power.

When he swung his arm as if falling forward, a whooshing sound burst out as the snowball flew.

When it struck the target precisely, Vivian cheered.

"Great! Success in one try! That's our school's ace for you!"
