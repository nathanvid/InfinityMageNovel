But it was too early to celebrate. The target that seemed about to fall had bounced back due to its elasticity.

"Too bad! First attempt failed!"

Vivian stared dumbfounded at the target swinging in a pendulum motion, then glared at the host with sharp eyes.

"Why did it fail? I hit it perfectly."

"No, no. I clearly said you have to knock the target down."

"This is pure fraud!"

"Haha! Fraud? Is this your first time at the winter festival? Everyone knows this much. Besides, do you know what kind of collection this is? If you resell it later, it's easily worth over 1 gold."

Jokre looked at Rudbans and asked.

"Looks like there's a spring attached at the bottom. Can you do it?"

"Well... there are still nine shots left."

Rudbans positioned the snowball for an easy grip and studied the target.

'They've made the angle tricky to calculate. I guess there's no choice but to go with a fastball?'

Over the next 10 minutes, he threw all remaining 9 snowballs.

Though Rudbans maintained his expressionless face throughout his determined attempt, sweat beaded on his forehead and steam rose from his head.

"Close. One more would have done it."

The challenge was a failure.

He had hit shots 2 and 3 consecutively, but missing shots 4, 5, and 6 was his downfall.

Hitting a target with maximum force from a distance greater than a stadium wasn't easy even for a semi-professional.

With renewed determination, he powerfully hit every snowball from shot 7 onward, but still the target didn't fall.

Sirone gained a hint from this.

'You have to use the elasticity to knock it over. I thought it was strange that they installed a spring on the target.'

If you hit the target consecutively while the pendulum motion still has force, the elasticity gradually increases. Eventually, when it passes the critical point, it can't overcome the weight and falls—that was the structure.

Rudbans' accuracy of hitting 7 out of 10 shots was impressive, but he failed because the force wasn't applied consecutively.

"Amy, how about you give it a try?"

"Huh? Me?"

Amy looked back at Sirone with surprise.

In fact, with her playful nature, there was no way her hands wouldn't itch to try such a fun game. But usually, guys tried these challenges to show off in front of girls, so she had just been watching.

'Ah, so that's the situation.'

She seemed to understand Sirone's intention. The person who needed to show off here was herself.

'In that case, no need to hold back.'

Amy walked to the host and paid 10 silver.

If Rudbans was the representative of siege students, Amy had her pride as a future sniper on the line.

"I'd like to challenge too. Here's 10 silver."

"Ho, it's been a while since we had a female challenger! But miss, the soldier in the watchtower isn't swayed by beauty. Still, I'll give you one extra snowball as a bonus, so do your best."

"No, it's fine. Ten is enough."

"Haha! What a spirited young lady! Everyone, let's give this brave miss a round of applause!"

When the delicate girl who looked like she might not even be able to throw a snowball to the watchtower stepped up to challenge, the spectators burst into applause.

Amy moistened her lips with her tongue and picked up a snowball. Her pupils reddened as her self-image memory recorded her current state.

"Here goes."

With a cute motion, she swung her arm, and the snowball fell like a dud, not even making it halfway.

Good-natured laughter erupted from the tourists.

But Sirone held his breath watching. Amy's true worth was just beginning.

Unlike shot 1, Amy properly positioned herself and stared intently at the target.

The information from her self-image memory corrected errors and made her brain sense the accurate trajectory.

Gripping the snowball firmly through the basic Schema build of strength enhancement, she widened her stance and swung her arm in a large arc.

When the snowball flew at a speed similar to Rudbans' and hit the target, the spectators' eyes widened.

Amy stored the state of shot 2 in her Insight again. Then she mechanically threw shots 3, 4, and 5.

Each time a snowball hit, the target's swaying grew larger, until finally it couldn't withstand the 8th shot and fell over with a crash.

"Wooooah! She knocked it down! A girl knocked down the target!"

"Miss, are you an athlete by any chance? That was really amazing!"

Amy looked up at the ceiling with relief and exhaled.

Having tried it herself, it was definitely a high-difficulty game. Even if a Schema user came, if they hadn't trained their sensory system, they would struggle.

Of course, a Schema master could knock down the target in one shot with cannon-like power, but such a person wouldn't make a fool of themselves at a festival just to win a doll.

The host gladly handed over the prize to the successful challenger.

Amy received the Ice Queen doll, thanked those who had cheered for her, and lifted it up like a trophy.

Vivian looked enviously at the Ice Queen doll that was smiling in a crescent shape.

"Ah, I'm jealous. I wanted that."

Sirone and Amy were walking away excitedly, completely forgetting about Jokre's group.

Rudbans said.

"...This is kind of annoying."

Jokre felt the same way.

"Hmph, she's only cared about herself since childhood. That's why she failed the graduation exam with that personality. They say she got beaten up by a group. That's why the only person she can get along with is a commoner."

Sirone and Amy only remembered Jokre's group after they had already reached the first floor.

They didn't feel like going back. They weren't people who had approached them with good feelings from the start.

Amy hugged the Ice Queen doll to her chest and rubbed her cheek against it, feeling its soft texture.

"Hehe! It's really cute."

Just watching made Sirone feel happy.

Unlike her outward personality, she liked cute dolls. Weren't there numerous teddy bear dolls in her room?

'I'm glad she has normal tastes.'

He truly thought so.

Something like Uorin's collection of El Crouch porcelain dolls couldn't be worth collecting unless you had bad taste.

"I paid 20 silver and won, so assuming I only get 1 gold, I've earned 80 silver."

"Haha! That's such a you way of thinking. But isn't it past time to calculate such things? The magic school's greatest tycoon?"

"Greatest tycoon? Me?"

Amy pointed to Sirone's coat.

"Armang. Just its stolen goods value is over 2 billion gold, right? Then at auction it would go for at least double that, wouldn't it? In other words, you're currently walking around carrying our entire school."

Only then realizing this, Sirone blinked.

The amount was so beyond common sense that he hadn't even dared to consider the sword's value.

Thinking that he was walking among countless people wearing an S-class Objet worth over 4 billion gold, he suddenly felt a stitch in his side where he wore the sword.

'What if someone steals it? No wait, since we share consciousness, it can't be stolen.'

Amy carefully put the Ice Queen doll in her bag. Watching her, Sirone pointed outside.

"It's hot from the game, so let's go out and cool off too."

"Yeah. I need some fresh air too. Should we go skating? I heard the ice quality here is really good."

Sirone nodded readily.

He remembered playing excitedly on the frozen lake with the skates his father had made for him as a child.

"Great! Then let's head to the skating rink!"

**Philosophy of Battle Mages (1)**

The skating rink was full of couples.

Sirone and Amy joined the flow circling the outer edge of the rink and skated.

The cold winter wind hit them refreshingly.

While gliding over the ice following the person ahead, Amy could momentarily forget her real-world worries.

But her good mood disappeared the moment she saw Jokre's group entering the skating rink.

Not joining the flow, they showed off skating tricks in the center of the rink.

It wasn't against regulations, but perhaps because she already disliked them, Amy didn't like even that.

"What? Did they follow us here too?"

"They probably came to skate. Don't mind them."

Amy didn't want to get involved with Jokre's group.

Every time she saw them proudly enjoying their leisure after passing the graduation exam, the wound of failure felt like it was reopening.

"Forget it. Let's just avoid them. We've cooled off anyway, and I want to look around other places."

"Should we? Alright."

Sirone and Amy pushed off with their skate blades, heading toward the exit.

"Hey! Leaving already?"

When Sirone turned around, Jokre was waving his arms and rushing toward them at full speed.

Hurriedly pulling Amy aside, Jokre changed direction and made a sudden stop. His skate blade scraped the ice, spraying ice powder with a whoosh. As the cold particles hit his face, Sirone's brow furrowed.

"What exactly are you doing? Spraying that at people's faces."

"Haha! Why get angry over something like that? You're more petty than I heard. It was just a joke."

"So why are you playing jokes?"

Amy pushed Sirone aside and stepped forward.

"Why do you keep following us? If you have something to say, say it properly. Don't act childish like kids."

"We haven't seen each other in a while. This is fate too, so let's have fun together. We still have some unfinished business to resolve between us."

"Resolve? What resolve?"

All Amy could think of regarding Jokre was that he had given up competing at a prestigious school and transferred to another school as if running away.

'Huh? Don't tell me...'

A vague scene floated in Amy's mind.

Before transferring, Jokre had confessed his love to her.

At the time, it was routine. It was such a trivial incident that it was amazing it remained in her memory at all.

But today, she was conscious of Sirone's presence.

Even if it was said as a joke, no woman in the world would take the word "date" as just a joke.

Amy was a woman and not an idiot.

If a man and woman went on a 2-night, 3-day trip alone together, she was fully prepared that anything could happen when she decided to follow Sirone.

She didn't want to make Sirone uncomfortable with some ridiculous past incident.

Simply having received a confession wouldn't feel bad, but having the person involved standing right there was a different matter.

"Forget it. I don't want to talk with you. Sirone, let's go somewhere else. We don't need to associate with people like this."

As Amy tried to leave, Jokre approached her, passing by Sirone dismissively.

"Wait a minute. Let's finish what we were talking about..."

Jokre stopped speaking and turned his head. Sirone was gripping his shoulder with a frown.

"She said she doesn't want to."

"You, won't you let go? Even though we're at different schools, I'm your senior. I'm a certified mage."

"That's one thing, this is another."

Jokre was dumbfounded by Sirone's impudence.

"A lowly commoner acting so arrogant just because people around here pamper you. You know what? Amy and I have known each other since we were thirteen. It's none of your business."

"What does when you met matter? If we're going by that, we met when we were twelve. Stop bothering someone who doesn't want it and please leave."

"What? You met when you were twelve?"

Jokre was astounded by Sirone's lie.

Thanks to memorizing academic journals, he knew about Sirone's past too.

How could someone who had only been at magic school for one year have met Amy when he was twelve?

Especially the son of a mountain hunter who wasn't even nobility.

"You're surprisingly shameless. You think such lies will work? Do you know what happens when you get on a senior's bad side in this field? Especially someone like you with nowhere to cling to—you just get expelled."

"If it's a place with seniors who make petty threats, I wouldn't want to enter anyway."

"This bastard really!"

At Sirone's attitude of not backing down to a single word, Jokre lost his reason and raised his fist.

But just as he was about to swing, a snowball flew from somewhere and hit the back of his head with a thud.
