[338] Wave of Law (3)

"How about you get a grip on reality? Don't you understand the situation we're in? You might be the best at school, but do you think your reputation means anything in a place like this?"

Shirone wasn't listening to Jokre's words.

If he held out like this, people would die. But if that was going to happen anyway, there was a much simpler solution.

Shirone narrowed his field of vision like a sniper. The Ice Queen's face came into sharp focus.

'I have to end this in one strike.'

Eliminate the Ice Queen in the shortest time possible.

If he could do that, the strange ability dominating this space would disappear as well.

As Shirone maintained his poker face, Jokre felt psychological pressure building.

It was like being in a poker game where someone who definitely had a royal flush was going all-in with their fortune.

'What kind of people are these?'

To show such nerve when hundreds of lives were at stake—by his common sense, it was impossible.

They were looking down on him. The moment that thought occurred to him, uncontrollable rage surged up.

"How dare you look down on me!"

The moment Jokre shouted, Shirone's Armang slipped from its sheath and rushed forward like lightning.

Armang's target wasn't Jokre, but the Ice Queen.

The Ice Queen activated the law and quickly retreated. Even so, when she fell behind in speed, she flew up into the sky entirely.

'Law of Destruction.'

The Ice Queen's law was cast upon Armang. But the magic sword only trembled and wasn't destroyed.

'Why?'

This was an unfamiliar experience for the Ice Queen.

'An incarnate body?'

Objects that achieved perfect Trinity couldn't be changed by laws, and in Heaven they were called incarnate bodies.

The Ice Queen activated the Law of Freezing. Frost formed on Armang's blade and ice began to accumulate.

As the speed slowed, the Ice Queen regained her composure. But suddenly, as if she had collided with something, an impact struck her back.

'What?'

Without time to find an answer to her question, she amplified the Law of Freezing. Armang, trapped in a massive chunk of ice, couldn't bear the weight and crashed to the ground.

The Ice Queen immediately turned around and cast Wave of Law at the point where she had collided. With a bang, a translucent dome-shaped barrier spread across the sky.

'Something is blocking the space.'

Jokre wore a dazed expression. Dante, who had spent all night installing the sealing formation, spoke triumphantly.

"How's that, my surprise gift? This area is already sealed off. I spent all night planting totems to set up a sealing formation. The Ice Queen absolutely cannot escape from here."

Jokre slowly turned his head to look at Dante. The Ice Queen was trapped. It was the worst possible situation he could imagine.

"You think you can dominate the world by clinging to a monster like that? Does the place you live in look that easy to you? The army will be mobilized soon. Even if we die here, the Ice Queen will eventually be destroyed. End this on good terms now. Then there might be room for leniency."

Jokre's jaw trembled. His breathing became rough. If the army was mobilized, the Ice Queen would be destroyed. Of course, he and his friends would pay the price for their serious crimes as well.

"You have trapped me."

The Ice Queen landed. The cold air she brought with her spread across the earth, chilling people to the bone.

Shirone didn't avoid the Ice Queen's killing intent. Rather, he met her eyes as if challenging her to come at him, snatching the handle of Armang as it returned after breaking through the ice. The jewel embedded in the cross guard was emitting an intense red light. It recognized that the opponent from their brief exchange was not to be underestimated.

"Your Majesty, are you alright?"

The Ice Queen looked back at Jokre, who asked with concern, and gave an affectionate eye-smile while stroking his head.

But when she looked back at Shirone, her gaze was completely different. Her cold stare seemed to pierce through his heart like a spear of ice.

"Why do you interfere with me?"

"You can see what you've done and still ask? And wasn't it you who first treated other people's lives carelessly?"

"Foolish. The strong dominate. Isn't that the rule of the world you live in? I am merely trying to reign over you as a new ruler."

Cold air rose above the Ice Queen's head.

"Freezing Mist."

Cold air spread rapidly with the Ice Queen at the center. Shirone's coat froze solid and cracked with a snap. The cooling speed was too fast. If just a few more seconds passed like this, the hearts of the people nearby would freeze solid.

"Danger!"

Liria cast a localized sealing formation at the Ice Queen's feet. A circular formation was drawn with light, and a reddish pillar of light shot up high.

"Kugh!"

The Ice Queen's face contorted. It felt as if something fundamental that comprised her being was being drained downward, like an object unable to defy the law of gravity.

As the Ice Queen summoned the law and soared into the sky, Liria looked up with a regretful expression.

"No good. Her activity is too strong, so a localized sealing formation can't contain her. We need to somehow bind her."

The Ice Queen's face, unable to control her expression, was grotesque. The power of the sealing formation was that tremendous. Even when her brain had been burning, she hadn't felt such fear of annihilation.

"I will not forgive you!"

When the Ice Queen cast Wave of Law, the laws around people's necks disappeared and new laws were born.

"Graaaah!"

People's snouts protruded like dogs and their teeth became pointed. Their muscles swelled, tearing their clothes, and their claws grew long like wolves. Hardened skin protruded like armor.

"She's evolving them into a state suitable for combat!"

At Liria's words, Dante shouted.

"Let's finish this before they join the fight. If we concentrate our firepower, we can win. Liria, focus on defending against the laws."

Just as Shirone's group was about to fly toward the Ice Queen, Vivian placed both hands on the ground and muttered.

"Spirit's Radius."

As Vivian's body turned to stone, the ground shook. Circular barriers rose up in succession around her, spreading outward.

Thoom! Thoom! Thoom! Thoom! Thoom!

The distance between walls that spread out in the form of radiation every 10 meters was 10 meters. And all of this radius constituted her mind.

"Damn! What is this!"

Shirone's group hastily retreated, but before they could take a few steps, a wall rose up behind them. It was a 30-meter-high barrier.

As they panicked, the front wall melted softly and Vivian's face protruded in relief. Her upper body emerged, and her lower body stretched out like a snake, connected to the wall.

"Hehe. How's that? My ability, Spirit's Radius."

When Vivian raised both hands, Jokre and Rudbans jumped down and landed like cranes on her palms.

"Haha! How pathetic. You were acting so smart, but this is all you amount to?"

Spirit's Radius erected barriers shared with the caster's mind at a rate of 10 meters per second. However, as the radius widened, the density of the mind thinned, so if walls were built too far away, reactions would drop to the level of inanimate objects. But Vivian was satisfied with her ability. The Ice Queen had accurately manifested the psychology of someone who wanted everyone's attention as an ability.

"This place is a perfect maze. If you catch me at the center, Spirit's Radius will be released. But can you find your way?"

"No need to scurry around like mice."

Dante cast spatial teleportation. A 30-meter barrier was something he could just jump over. But numerous Vivians emerged from the top and swung their petrified hands.

"Tch! This is troublesome."

If he collided with the petrified Vivians through linear spatial teleportation, he couldn't avoid fatal injuries. As Dante landed with an annoyed expression, Shirone held up Armang vertically.

"I'll take care of the Ice Queen."

The moment everyone looked at Shirone, he recited.

"Armament."

The blade split and thin skeletal frames like insect legs swallowed Shirone's face. As he instantly transformed into a mage with his hood pulled deep down, Jokre's group's faces hardened.

Dante asked.

"Is that Armament? What are you planning?"

"Armang withstood the law. With Armament, I might be able to block the Ice Queen's laws."

Liria nodded.

"It's possible. It's the same principle as totems. But the Ice Queen is in the sky. Finding a way to break out comes first."

Shirone raised his face hidden by the hood. Spirit's Radius, which created clones at the speed of thought, was certainly a difficult obstacle. But it wasn't as if there was no way to escape at all.

'Function comes from form.'

Shirone maximized his photon sculpture technique. Light blazed intensely from his body, and massive wings of light spread out.

He had sculpted light.

This fact amazed the mages. To shape form with luminescent light represented tremendous photon compression power.

Jokre's group also swallowed dryly. Everyone knew what Shirone intended to do, as he had sculpted a form that performed only one function—to fly through the sky.

"I'll leave this place to you."

Photon Sculpture—Light Wings.

Shirone crouched down and swept his light wings downward, shooting up at tremendous speed. Even though it wasn't spatial teleportation, it seemed like lightning was shooting up.

'As if I'll let you escape!'

Even so, Vivian reacted. Dozens of Vivians emerged from the walls and bit down on Shirone like teeth.

'Got him!'

The impact was definitely transmitted. But shortly after, Vivian furrowed her brow in puzzlement. Armament's tentacles were blocking the petrified clones' attacks at close range.

"This is...!"

Vivian poured all her strength into it. The sound of stone being worn down could be heard from where Shirone was. The brute force derived from stone's durability was tremendous, but the indestructible tentacles were also powerful enough to crush ordinary rock.

—External pressure 1.7 tons. Muscle strength maintenance limit reached.

Shirone gritted his teeth and pushed the tentacles downward. The tentacles that squeezed through the narrow gap catapulted Shirone upward, and Vivian's clones collided with each other and shattered.

'Eliminate the Ice Queen.'

The speed generated by Light Wings was fearsome. Shirone pursued the Ice Queen at near-sonic speed. As his vision narrowed, Armang readjusted his physical abilities.

—Target recognition impossible. Increasing photoreceptor cells. Enhancing macular function.

His vision opened wide and the Ice Queen became clearly visible. The artificial brain balanced his flight. As the distance closed, the Ice Queen turned around and cast a law.

"Freezing Blizzard."

As snowflakes sharper than razor blades whirled around, Shirone covered his face. As his cloak covering his entire body hardened into a metallic substance, ice fragments scratched the surface like thousands of pieces of breaking glass.

"Kugh!"

The Ice Queen's laws weren't as sharply purposeful as magic, but they were on a different dimension in terms of scale. Her rules were greater than the rules of this place. That was scale.

Shirone changed his hardened cloak back to organic material and glared forward. The atmosphere had frozen solid, with massive ice stems spreading out in complex patterns like a human nervous system. It felt like becoming a microorganism at the microscopic level.

'So it's extremely low temperature.'

The reason he couldn't feel the cold was because Armang was controlling his nervous system. But when he breathed in, the cold air immediately began to freeze his lungs.

"Hah!"

Shirone quickly closed his mouth.

—Breathing blockage detected. Substituting artificial oxygen. Remaining oxygen consumption time: 1 minute 27 seconds. 2 minutes 32 seconds. 4 minutes 49 seconds.

Armang began stockpiling air while directly injecting oxygen into Shirone's blood vessels. Having regained his combat ability, Shirone flew between the ice stems and engaged in aerial combat with the Ice Queen.

Like a hawk hunting, Shirone folded his Light Wings and rushed forward, grasping his wrist and firing 120 photon cannons per minute from the magic crystal sphere embedded in his gauntlet.
