# [341] Trinity (2)

His breathing became rough as his oxygen consumption skyrocketed.

—Remaining oxygen consumption time: 1 minute 17 seconds. 1 minute 3 seconds. 42 seconds.

Light flew from all directions, piercing into Shirone's body.

When access to the laws was blocked, it attempted to directly penetrate and melt his mind through physical means.

Armang reacted immediately.

—Neural junction point observed. Docking and copying.

Armang's tentacles connected with the needles of light. Then even more light surged forth, piercing into Shirone's body.

Dozens, hundreds.

The endlessly rushing light demanded one thing.

Be dismantled.

"Graaaah!"

Shirone wrinkled his nose bridge with a terrifying expression.

The feeling of his existence being absorbed by another was like the humiliation of being eaten alive by a beast.

—Remaining oxygen consumption time: 4 seconds. 3 seconds. 2 seconds.

At this rate, he would be absorbed.

"Insolent thing...!"

Shirone concentrated his mind on an endless single point.

Immortal Function opened, and infinite consciousness spread throughout the entire world of law.

—Immeasurable focal point detected. Penetrating.

Armang's organic matter multiplied infinitely. Tentacles extended out and docked without exception with all the thorns embedded in Shirone.

Having copied the information attempting to hack its master's brain, Armang began constructing an appropriate firewall based on that data.

And finally, Shirone and the Ice Queen came to share a single world as individual subjects of law.

—Firewall complete. Activating.

Light burst from Shirone's retinas.

Micro-world Creation.

"Where is this?"

Shirone looked around.

It was a dark space like the world of law. The difference was that there weren't even twinkling stars.

But Shirone could see.

'How can I see?'

Was it truly possible to see in a place without light?

'Perhaps...'

Shirone found an interesting answer.

Memory. There is no light in memories.

Because light does not remain in the past.

But he was in reality.

Therefore, this was a space where all time was spread out. The entirety of time where past, present, and future could not even be distinguished.

As he took a step, countless Shirones approached from the curtain of darkness.

"What?"

He looked around once. As if space had been unfolded using mirrors, infinite numbers of himself were turning.

Shirone pointed to one and approached. As the distance shortened, the composition narrowed and numerous Shirones lined up in parallel.

There stood himself with pitch-black pupils and an evil face.

Shirone extended his hand. The other Shirone also extended his hand.

He felt the cold texture of a glass wall.

'Is this me?'

No, this is not me.

Where is this place? Outside the mirror or inside? Am I the one looking at the mirror, or am I the one reflected in the mirror?

"Ah..."

Shirone finally realized.

"This is..."

Both Shirones spoke simultaneously.

"You."

Crack crack crack crack crack crack BANG!

All the glass walls that had been spread out drawing infinite parallel lines rushed at the speed of light and burst forth.

Making the sound of shattering glass, the boundary surfaces of the mirrors began to be destroyed at the speed of light.

Shirone's and Shirone's hands touched. But before he could even feel the sensation, the Shirone on the opposite side disappeared.

Within the Ice Queen's law, Shirone and Shirone referred to each other, achieving perfect Trinity.

The evil Shirone with black pupils was no more. There was only the absolutely unchanging Shirone who would not be shaken by any law.

A technique called Avatar Art in Heaven. But mages considered this a single境地 and called it thus:

Mental Transcendence.

**The Protagonist of Life (1)**

Having completed the Trinity, Shirone's eyes snapped open. Simultaneously, through the multi-law network Micro-world Creation, Armang began to attack the Ice Queen's law in reverse.

The world shook and starlight flashed. Unable to endure Shirone, the Ice Queen stuck out her neck and vomited.

"Gack! Gack! Gaaaack!"

Amy's face, watching from the ground, turned pale. The sight of the giant face straining as if its eyeballs would pop out was beyond horrifying—it was pitiful.

"Gaaaaaaack!"

As the Ice Queen exerted her final strength, Shirone covered in tentacles was vomited out. Having spread his Light Wings wide and come to a stop, the first thing he did was inhale air.

"Whoa! Whoa!"

He realized for the first time that even air had taste.

"Shirone! Shirone has returned alive!"

Amy's face, which had been groaning as if she would die soon, finally regained color. Even the Ice Queen's grotesqueness couldn't surpass the joy of Shirone's safe return.

But Dante's gaze was still serious.

Above all, the Ice Queen's condition was strange.

The Ice Queen was making a bizarre expression that couldn't be created with human facial muscles. But that was precisely the form that most accurately revealed the Ice Queen's current emotions.

'Infinite? Infinite? Infinite? Infinite? Infinite?'

The Ice Queen was confused.

'What is that?'

As Armang constructed the firewall, the Ice Queen had also copied Shirone's information.

But there was a problem.

Immortal Function, which was difficult to analyze perfectly even with Optrus's vast information, had been installed.

As a massive sense of elation that transcended the Scale of law rushed in, the Ice Queen couldn't control her mouth opening on its own.

Going to infinity.

That was the only fact the Ice Queen could know.

Her endlessly opening jaw exceeded the range of joint movement and finally began to swallow herself in reverse.

Like grape skin peeling off and the flesh popping out, a new existence revealed itself from within the throat.

'I am infinite.'

With human faces attached to three sides and dozens of arms branching from the shoulders multiplying and spreading like peacock feathers.

Three-faced Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara.

This was Optrus's second devotion after absorbing Immortal Function.

"Galgalgalgalgalgalgalgal!"

A sound like thousands of beetles crying burst from the laughing Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara's mouth.

"Ugh!"

Hit directly by the surprise sound wave, Shirone adjusted his hearing through Armang and then created distance. Then the Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara's neck turned, and a face with upturned eye corners and downturned mouth corners took the front position. The law of rage exploded and countless fireballs shot out in all directions.

"Dangerous!"

As Liria pointed at the pouring rain of fire, Dante spread a giant defensive magic circle above their heads. The moment the fireballs struck, it made an explosive sound and cracked loudly.

"Ugh! Damn it!"

Dante had a bitter expression. While mental bodies had limited growth in isolated spaces, the mental body after swallowing Shirone was incomparably more powerful law than the Ice Queen. It was probably Immortal Function. Indeed, for a being that absorbed laws, there was no better tonic than Shirone.

"Deploy the sealing formation right now!"

Liria looked up at the aerial battle with confused eyes. Shirone was firing Photon Cannon in rapid succession, but it couldn't even scratch the Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara's body.

"Not yet. The range of the sealing formation is much narrower than the sealing formation. If we can't drag it here, it's better to die here instead."

Amy shouted toward the sky.

"Shirone! Push the monster this way!"

Armang copied Amy's voice. A noise-mixed voice was transmitted to Shirone's brain.

"Push it?"

It meant they had found some method on the ground. But how could he push a monster that didn't even budge from Photon Cannon?

'I have no choice.'

Shirone widened his eyes and concentrated on increasing the power of Photon Cannon. Then the mind of Mental Transcendence attempted massive expansion.

Immortal Function could borrow infinite mental power but couldn't increase power beyond Spirit Zone.

But Mental Transcendence forcibly strengthened Spirit Zone.

Of course, like Divine Transcendence, the mental aftershock that would come later was a separate matter.

Just as Rian's arm exploded when he thrust his sword faster than his body could handle, attempting more than the available capacity would destroy the mind instead.

—Focal point expansion. Overdrive activated.

But Shirone didn't hesitate. Feeling massive output he had never experienced before, when he extended his hand, dozens of flashes struck the Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara's torso directly.

"Galgalgalgalgalgalgalgal!"

The Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara's body, which had been motionless as if stuck in space, began to be pushed back little by little. While shooting sound waves in all directions, Shirone didn't stop his offensive. No, the power was becoming even stronger as time passed.

250 meters to go to the sealing formation installation point.

Those watching the battle from the ground were mesmerized by the spectacle of dozens of Photon Cannons flashing.

"How is such magic possible...?"

The shock was greatest for Liria, who was a mage. The reason she classified mental bodies as demigods was because they freely manipulated laws. Beings of law must be sealed with laws. But Shirone was pushing back a demigod with pure physical force alone.

"...I thought he was just an innocent boy."

Dante smiled bitterly at Liria's mistake. This is what happens when you judge Shirone by his appearance. A rustic boy with no interest in fashion, calmly doing needlework in a cafe. But that was precisely the only boy who had beaten him.

"Well, he is most handsome when he's being a mage."

Liria was conflicted. She could see that the Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara's movement distance was gradually shortening. If Photon Cannon's power couldn't become stronger, driving it to the sealing formation installation point would be impossible.

"Liria. Deploy the sealing formation. Whether Shirone succeeds or fails, if something must be done, now is the last chance."

'What should I do?'

If the sealing formation failed, the Thousand-armed Avalokiteshvara would escape into the world. Even if the Kingdom prepared, given the scale of its laws, it was an enemy that could devastate small cities in just a few hours.

Liria looked back at Dante and said.

"I'll prepare the sealing formation."

There was no choice but to bet on Shirone. The people of the outside world were as precious as the people here. This was a different situation from not killing the monster.

"Good. Then I'll tell you the plan. When Shirone pushes in just 50 more meters, I'll construct defensive magic circles as a mansion to trap the monster. It won't be the same as the sealing formation, but it'll be a minimum safety device. Meanwhile, Amy, prepare magic to support Shirone with firepower."

Amy nodded.

"Got it. I'll cast the most powerful magic."

Jokre looked at them trying to fight desperately. Contrasting with his own helpless appearance, anger surged up.

Why were they risking their lives?

They could just leave. The punishment would all fall on him anyway, and the Kingdom would handle the aftermath.

"Why are you fighting?"

Dante, who was protecting Liria, turned his head.

"What are you saying? If you're thinking of interfering, I'll take you out first."

"Why fight? You're not guilty of anything, so you could just run away! Don't you want to live? With such strength, with such natural talent! With a bright future guaranteed, do you want to die a dog's death in a place like this?"

Dante looked at Jokre incredulously. But soon he sighed as if understanding.

"Did you learn magic because you wanted to succeed?"

"What?"

"Isn't the order reversed? You learned magic because you liked magic, and success followed because you became good at magic. Wouldn't your insides boil if you ran away from here? I'm just fighting with the magic I learned. So don't interfere and just watch quietly."

Amy, who had finished her sequence formula, opened her eyes.

"It's done. I'll start now."

Insight emitted red light as two pillars of fire rose from her feet and merged into a giant fireball. It was an Inferno several times larger than what she had shot from Spirit's Radius.

Jokre stared blankly at the fire burning like the sun, then realized something and lowered his head.

'Crazy magic maniacs...'
